A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA\\n\\n\\nI.\\n\\nTo Sherlock Holmes she is always _the_ woman. I have seldom heard him\\nmention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and\\npredominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion\\nakin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly,\\nwere abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He\\nwas, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that\\nthe world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a\\nfalse position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe\\nand a sneer. They were admirable things for the observerâ\\x80\\x94excellent for\\ndrawing the veil from menâ\\x80\\x99s motives and actions. But for the trained\\nreasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely\\nadjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might\\nthrow a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive\\ninstrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not\\nbe more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And\\nyet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene\\nAdler, of dubious and questionable memory.\\n\\nI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away\\nfrom each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred\\ninterests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master\\nof his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,\\nwhile Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian\\nsoul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old\\nbooks, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition,\\nthe drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen\\nnature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,\\nand occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of\\nobservation in following out those clues, and clearing up those\\nmysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.\\nFrom time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his\\nsummons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up\\nof the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and\\nfinally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and\\nsuccessfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of\\nhis activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of\\nthe daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\\n\\nOne nightâ\\x80\\x94it was on the twentieth of March, 1888â\\x80\\x94I was returning from a\\njourney to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when\\nmy way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered\\ndoor, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and\\nwith the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a\\nkeen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his\\nextraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I\\nlooked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette\\nagainst the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his\\nhead sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who\\nknew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own\\nstory. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created\\ndreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell\\nand was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\\n\\nHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,\\nto see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\\nme to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a\\nspirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire\\nand looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWedlock suits you,â\\x80\\x9d he remarked. â\\x80\\x9cI think, Watson, that you have put\\non seven and a half pounds since I saw you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSeven!â\\x80\\x9d I answered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIndeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I\\nfancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me\\nthat you intended to go into harness.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen, how do you know?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting\\nyourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless\\nservant girl?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear Holmes,â\\x80\\x9d said I, â\\x80\\x9cthis is too much. You would certainly have\\nbeen burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a\\ncountry walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I\\nhave changed my clothes I canâ\\x80\\x99t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary\\nJane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,\\nagain, I fail to see how you work it out.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is simplicity itself,â\\x80\\x9d said he; â\\x80\\x9cmy eyes tell me that on the inside\\nof your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is\\nscored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by\\nsomeone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in\\norder to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double\\ndeduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a\\nparticularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As\\nto your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of\\niodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right\\nforefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where\\nhe has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not\\npronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\\nprocess of deduction. â\\x80\\x9cWhen I hear you give your reasons,â\\x80\\x9d I remarked,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthe thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I\\ncould easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your\\nreasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I\\nbelieve that my eyes are as good as yours.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite so,â\\x80\\x9d he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\\ndown into an armchair. â\\x80\\x9cYou see, but you do not observe. The\\ndistinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps\\nwhich lead up from the hall to this room.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFrequently.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow often?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, some hundreds of times.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen how many are there?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow many? I donâ\\x80\\x99t know.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just\\nmy point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have\\nboth seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these\\nlittle problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two\\nof my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.â\\x80\\x9d He threw\\nover a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open\\nupon the table. â\\x80\\x9cIt came by the last post,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cRead it aloud.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock,â\\x80\\x9d it\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x9ca gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very\\ndeepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of\\nEurope have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with\\nmatters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.\\nThis account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your\\nchamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor\\nwear a mask.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is indeed a mystery,â\\x80\\x9d I remarked. â\\x80\\x9cWhat do you imagine that it\\nmeans?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has\\ndata. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of\\ntheories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from\\nit?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\\nwritten.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe man who wrote it was presumably well to do,â\\x80\\x9d I remarked,\\nendeavouring to imitate my companionâ\\x80\\x99s processes. â\\x80\\x9cSuch paper could not\\nbe bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and\\nstiff.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPeculiarâ\\x80\\x94that is the very word,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes. â\\x80\\x9cIt is not an English\\npaper at all. Hold it up to the light.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI did so, and saw a large â\\x80\\x9cEâ\\x80\\x9d with a small â\\x80\\x9cg,â\\x80\\x9d a â\\x80\\x9cP,â\\x80\\x9d and a large â\\x80\\x9cGâ\\x80\\x9d\\nwith a small â\\x80\\x9ctâ\\x80\\x9d woven into the texture of the paper.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you make of that?â\\x80\\x9d asked Holmes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot at all. The â\\x80\\x98Gâ\\x80\\x99 with the small â\\x80\\x98tâ\\x80\\x99 stands for â\\x80\\x98Gesellschaft,â\\x80\\x99\\nwhich is the German for â\\x80\\x98Company.â\\x80\\x99 It is a customary contraction like\\nour â\\x80\\x98Co.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98P,â\\x80\\x99 of course, stands for â\\x80\\x98Papier.â\\x80\\x99 Now for the â\\x80\\x98Eg.â\\x80\\x99 Let us\\nglance at our Continental Gazetteer.â\\x80\\x9d He took down a heavy brown volume\\nfrom his shelves. â\\x80\\x9cEglow, Eglonitzâ\\x80\\x94here we are, Egria. It is in a\\nGerman-speaking countryâ\\x80\\x94in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. â\\x80\\x98Remarkable\\nas being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous\\nglass-factories and paper-mills.â\\x80\\x99 Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of\\nthat?â\\x80\\x9d His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud\\nfrom his cigarette.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe paper was made in Bohemia,â\\x80\\x9d I said.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrecisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the\\npeculiar construction of the sentenceâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98This account of you we have from\\nall quarters received.â\\x80\\x99 A Frenchman or Russian could not have written\\nthat. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only\\nremains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who\\nwrites upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his\\nface. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our\\ndoubts.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horsesâ\\x80\\x99 hoofs and grating\\nwheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes\\nwhistled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA pair, by the sound,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, glancing out of\\nthe window. â\\x80\\x9cA nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred\\nand fifty guineas apiece. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s money in this case, Watson, if there\\nis nothing else.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think that I had better go, Holmes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.\\nAnd this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut your clientâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.\\nSit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the\\npassage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and\\nauthoritative tap.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome in!â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes.\\n\\nA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches\\nin height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich\\nwith a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad\\ntaste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and\\nfronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was\\nthrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and\\nsecured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming\\nberyl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were\\ntrimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of\\nbarbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He\\ncarried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper\\npart of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard\\nmask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand\\nwas still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face\\nhe appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,\\nand a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length\\nof obstinacy.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou had my note?â\\x80\\x9d he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly\\nmarked German accent. â\\x80\\x9cI told you that I would call.â\\x80\\x9d He looked from\\none to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPray take a seat,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes. â\\x80\\x9cThis is my friend and colleague, Dr.\\nWatson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom\\nhave I the honour to address?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I\\nunderstand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and\\ndiscretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme\\nimportance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you\\nalone.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into\\nmy chair. â\\x80\\x9cIt is both, or none,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cYou may say before this\\ngentleman anything which you may say to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe Count shrugged his broad shoulders. â\\x80\\x9cThen I must begin,â\\x80\\x9d said he,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cby binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of\\nthat time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too\\nmuch to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon\\nEuropean history.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI promise,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd I.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will excuse this mask,â\\x80\\x9d continued our strange visitor. â\\x80\\x9cThe august\\nperson who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may\\nconfess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is\\nnot exactly my own.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was aware of it,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes dryly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to\\nbe taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and\\nseriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak\\nplainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary\\nkings of Bohemia.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was also aware of that,â\\x80\\x9d murmured Holmes, settling himself down in\\nhis armchair and closing his eyes.\\n\\nOur visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,\\nlounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the\\nmost incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes\\nslowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf your Majesty would condescend to state your case,â\\x80\\x9d he remarked, â\\x80\\x9cI\\nshould be better able to advise you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in\\nuncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore\\nthe mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. â\\x80\\x9cYou are right,â\\x80\\x9d\\nhe cried; â\\x80\\x9cI am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, indeed?â\\x80\\x9d murmured Holmes. â\\x80\\x9cYour Majesty had not spoken before I\\nwas aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von\\nOrmstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of\\nBohemia.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you can understand,â\\x80\\x9d said our strange visitor, sitting down once\\nmore and passing his hand over his high white forehead, â\\x80\\x9cyou can\\nunderstand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own\\nperson. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to\\nan agent without putting myself in his power. I have come _incognito_\\nfrom Prague for the purpose of consulting you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen, pray consult,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy\\nvisit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress,\\nIrene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKindly look her up in my index, Doctor,â\\x80\\x9d murmured Holmes without\\nopening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing\\nall paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to\\nname a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish\\ninformation. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between\\nthat of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a\\nmonograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet me see!â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes. â\\x80\\x9cHum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858.\\nContraltoâ\\x80\\x94hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsawâ\\x80\\x94yes!\\nRetired from operatic stageâ\\x80\\x94ha! Living in Londonâ\\x80\\x94quite so! Your\\nMajesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person,\\nwrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting\\nthose letters back.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrecisely so. But howâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWas there a secret marriage?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNone.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo legal papers or certificates?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNone.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should\\nproduce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to\\nprove their authenticity?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is the writing.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPooh, pooh! Forgery.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy private note-paper.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStolen.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy own seal.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cImitated.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy photograph.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBought.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe were both in the photograph.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an\\nindiscretion.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was madâ\\x80\\x94insane.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have compromised yourself seriously.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt must be recovered.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe have tried and failed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour Majesty must pay. It must be bought.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe will not sell.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStolen, then.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFive attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her\\nhouse. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has\\nbeen waylaid. There has been no result.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo sign of it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbsolutely none.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHolmes laughed. â\\x80\\x9cIt is quite a pretty little problem,â\\x80\\x9d said he.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut a very serious one to me,â\\x80\\x9d returned the King reproachfully.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo ruin me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut how?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am about to be married.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo I have heard.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of\\nScandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is\\nherself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct\\nwould bring the matter to an end.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd Irene Adler?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThreatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that\\nshe will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She\\nhas the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most\\nresolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no\\nlengths to which she would not goâ\\x80\\x94none.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are sure that she has not sent it yet?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am sure.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd why?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause she has said that she would send it on the day when the\\nbetrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, then we have three days yet,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes with a yawn. â\\x80\\x9cThat is\\nvery fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into\\njust at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the\\npresent?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count\\nVon Kramm.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPray do so. I shall be all anxiety.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen, as to money?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have _carte blanche_.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbsolutely?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to\\nhave that photograph.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd for present expenses?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid\\nit on the table.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,â\\x80\\x9d he\\nsaid.\\n\\nHolmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it\\nto him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd Mademoiselleâ\\x80\\x99s address?â\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. Johnâ\\x80\\x99s Wood.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHolmes took a note of it. â\\x80\\x9cOne other question,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cWas the\\nphotograph a cabinet?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have\\nsome good news for you. And good-night, Watson,â\\x80\\x9d he added, as the\\nwheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. â\\x80\\x9cIf you will be\\ngood enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three oâ\\x80\\x99clock I should like\\nto chat this little matter over with you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\nII.\\n\\nAt three oâ\\x80\\x99clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not\\nyet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house\\nshortly after eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire,\\nhowever, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be.\\nI was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was\\nsurrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were\\nassociated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still,\\nthe nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a\\ncharacter of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the\\ninvestigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his\\nmasterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which\\nmade it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the\\nquick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable\\nmysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very\\npossibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.\\n\\nIt was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking\\ngroom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and\\ndisreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my\\nfriendâ\\x80\\x99s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three\\ntimes before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he\\nvanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes\\ntweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his\\npockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed\\nheartily for some minutes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, really!â\\x80\\x9d he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he\\nwas obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed\\nmy morning, or what I ended by doing.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and\\nperhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however.\\nI left the house a little after eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock this morning in the\\ncharacter of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and\\nfreemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all\\nthat there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a _bijou_\\nvilla, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to\\nthe road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on\\nthe right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor,\\nand those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could\\nopen. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window\\ncould be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and\\nexamined it closely from every point of view, but without noting\\nanything else of interest.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there\\nwas a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent\\nthe ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in\\nexchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco,\\nand as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say\\nnothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was\\nnot in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to\\nlisten to.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd what of Irene Adler?â\\x80\\x9d I asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, she has turned all the menâ\\x80\\x99s heads down in that part. She is the\\ndaintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the\\nSerpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives\\nout at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom\\ngoes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male\\nvisitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing,\\nnever calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey\\nNorton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a\\nconfidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews,\\nand knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I\\nbegan to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think\\nover my plan of campaign.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter.\\nHe was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between\\nthem, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client,\\nhis friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably\\ntransferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less\\nlikely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should\\ncontinue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the\\ngentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it\\nwidened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these\\ndetails, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are\\nto understand the situation.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am following you closely,â\\x80\\x9d I answered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up\\nto Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably\\nhandsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustachedâ\\x80\\x94evidently the man of whom\\nI had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman\\nto wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of\\na man who was thoroughly at home.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of\\nhim in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking\\nexcitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently\\nhe emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to\\nthe cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it\\nearnestly, â\\x80\\x98Drive like the devil,â\\x80\\x99 he shouted, â\\x80\\x98first to Gross &\\nHankeyâ\\x80\\x99s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the\\nEdgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAway they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well\\nto follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman\\nwith his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all\\nthe tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadnâ\\x80\\x99t\\npulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only\\ncaught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with\\na face that a man might die for.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98The Church of St. Monica, John,â\\x80\\x99 she cried, â\\x80\\x98and half a sovereign if\\nyou reach it in twenty minutes.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether\\nI should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a\\ncab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby\\nfare, but I jumped in before he could object. â\\x80\\x98The Church of St.\\nMonica,â\\x80\\x99 said I, â\\x80\\x98and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty\\nminutes.â\\x80\\x99 It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was\\nclear enough what was in the wind.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy cabby drove fast. I donâ\\x80\\x99t think I ever drove faster, but the others\\nwere there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses\\nwere in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried\\ninto the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had\\nfollowed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with\\nthem. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I\\nlounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a\\nchurch. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to\\nme, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Thank God,â\\x80\\x99 he cried. â\\x80\\x98Youâ\\x80\\x99ll do. Come! Come!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98What then?â\\x80\\x99 I asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it wonâ\\x80\\x99t be legal.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I\\nfound myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and\\nvouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in\\nthe secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton,\\nbachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman\\nthanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the\\nclergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position\\nin which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it\\nthat started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some\\ninformality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused\\nto marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky\\nappearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the\\nstreets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I\\nmean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is a very unexpected turn of affairs,â\\x80\\x9d said I; â\\x80\\x9cand what then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the\\npair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt\\nand energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they\\nseparated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. â\\x80\\x98I\\nshall drive out in the park at five as usual,â\\x80\\x99 she said as she left\\nhim. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I\\nwent off to make my own arrangements.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhich are?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSome cold beef and a glass of beer,â\\x80\\x9d he answered, ringing the bell. â\\x80\\x9cI\\nhave been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still\\nthis evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI shall be delighted.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t mind breaking the law?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot in the least.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNor running a chance of arrest?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot in a good cause.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, the cause is excellent!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen I am your man.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was sure that I might rely on you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what is it you wish?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you.\\nNow,â\\x80\\x9d he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our\\nlandlady had provided, â\\x80\\x9cI must discuss it while I eat, for I have not\\nmuch time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene\\nof action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at\\nseven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd what then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur.\\nThere is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere,\\ncome what may. You understand?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am to be neutral?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small\\nunpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed\\ninto the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window\\nwill open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd when I raise my handâ\\x80\\x94soâ\\x80\\x94you will throw into the room what I give\\nyou to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You\\nquite follow me?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEntirely.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is nothing very formidable,â\\x80\\x9d he said, taking a long cigar-shaped\\nroll from his pocket. â\\x80\\x9cIt is an ordinary plumberâ\\x80\\x99s smoke-rocket, fitted\\nwith a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is\\nconfined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up\\nby quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the\\nstreet, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made\\nmyself clear?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at\\nthe signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and\\nto wait you at the corner of the street.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrecisely.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you may entirely rely on me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare\\nfor the new role I have to play.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the\\ncharacter of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His\\nbroad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic\\nsmile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such\\nas Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that\\nHolmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul\\nseemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a\\nfine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a\\nspecialist in crime.\\n\\nIt was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still\\nwanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine\\nAvenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as\\nwe paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming\\nof its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from\\nSherlock Holmesâ\\x80\\x99 succinct description, but the locality appeared to be\\nless private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a\\nquiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of\\nshabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a\\nscissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a\\nnurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and\\ndown with cigars in their mouths.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou see,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the\\nhouse, â\\x80\\x9cthis marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes\\na double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse\\nto its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming\\nto the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find\\nthe photograph?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere, indeed?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet\\nsize. Too large for easy concealment about a womanâ\\x80\\x99s dress. She knows\\nthat the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two\\nattempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that\\nshe does not carry it about with her.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHer banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am\\ninclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like\\nto do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else?\\nShe could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what\\nindirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a\\nbusiness man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within\\na few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be\\nin her own house.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut it has twice been burgled.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPshaw! They did not know how to look.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut how will you look?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will not look.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will get her to show me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut she will refuse.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her\\ncarriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the\\ncurve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to\\nthe door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at\\nthe corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a\\ncopper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with\\nthe same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by\\nthe two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the\\nscissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was\\nstruck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage,\\nwas the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who\\nstruck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes\\ndashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her,\\nhe gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely\\ndown his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one\\ndirection and the loungers in the other, while a number of better\\ndressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it,\\ncrowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene\\nAdler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she\\nstood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of\\nthe hall, looking back into the street.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs the poor gentleman much hurt?â\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe is dead,â\\x80\\x9d cried several voices.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, thereâ\\x80\\x99s life in him!â\\x80\\x9d shouted another. â\\x80\\x9cBut heâ\\x80\\x99ll be gone\\nbefore you can get him to hospital.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s a brave fellow,â\\x80\\x9d said a woman. â\\x80\\x9cThey would have had the ladyâ\\x80\\x99s\\npurse and watch if it hadnâ\\x80\\x99t been for him. They were a gang, and a\\nrough one, too. Ah, heâ\\x80\\x99s breathing now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe canâ\\x80\\x99t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSurely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa.\\nThis way, please!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSlowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the\\nprincipal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by\\nthe window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn,\\nso that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know\\nwhether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he\\nwas playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of\\nmyself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I\\nwas conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon\\nthe injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes\\nto draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened\\nmy heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I\\nthought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from\\ninjuring another.\\n\\nHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who\\nis in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At\\nthe same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my\\nrocket into the room with a cry of â\\x80\\x9cFire!â\\x80\\x9d The word was no sooner out\\nof my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and\\nillâ\\x80\\x94gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maidsâ\\x80\\x94joined in a general shriek of\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFire!â\\x80\\x9d Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the\\nopen window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later\\nthe voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false\\nalarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner\\nof the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friendâ\\x80\\x99s arm\\nin mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly\\nand in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the\\nquiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou did it very nicely, Doctor,â\\x80\\x9d he remarked. â\\x80\\x9cNothing could have been\\nbetter. It is all right.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have the photograph?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know where it is.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd how did you find out?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe showed me, as I told you she would.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am still in the dark.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do not wish to make a mystery,â\\x80\\x9d said he, laughing. â\\x80\\x9cThe matter was\\nperfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was\\nan accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI guessed as much.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the\\npalm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my\\nface, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat also I could fathom.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could\\nshe do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I\\nsuspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to\\nsee which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were\\ncompelled to open the window, and you had your chance.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow did that help you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire,\\nher instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It\\nis a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken\\nadvantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it\\nwas of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married\\nwoman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.\\nNow it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house\\nmore precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to\\nsecure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting\\nwere enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The\\nphotograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right\\nbell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as\\nshe half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she\\nreplaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have\\nnot seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the\\nhouse. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once;\\nbut the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it\\nseemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd now?â\\x80\\x9d I asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOur quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King\\nto-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown\\ninto the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that\\nwhen she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be\\na satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd when will you call?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a\\nclear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a\\ncomplete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without\\ndelay.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was\\nsearching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting\\nappeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve heard that voice before,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit\\nstreet. â\\x80\\x9cNow, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\nIII.\\n\\nI slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast\\nand coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the\\nroom.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have really got it!â\\x80\\x9d he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either\\nshoulder and looking eagerly into his face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot yet.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you have hopes?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have hopes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen, come. I am all impatience to be gone.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe must have a cab.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, my brougham is waiting.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen that will simplify matters.â\\x80\\x9d We descended and started off once\\nmore for Briony Lodge.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIrene Adler is married,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Holmes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMarried! When?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesterday.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut to whom?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo an English lawyer named Norton.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut she could not love him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am in hopes that she does.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd why in hopes?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If\\nthe lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does\\nnot love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with\\nyour Majestyâ\\x80\\x99s plan.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is true. And yetâ\\x80\\x94! Well! I wish she had been of my own station!\\nWhat a queen she would have made!â\\x80\\x9d He relapsed into a moody silence,\\nwhich was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.\\n\\nThe door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the\\nsteps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the\\nbrougham.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?â\\x80\\x9d said she.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am Mr. Holmes,â\\x80\\x9d answered my companion, looking at her with a\\nquestioning and rather startled gaze.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIndeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left\\nthis morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for\\nthe Continent.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat!â\\x80\\x9d Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and\\nsurprise. â\\x80\\x9cDo you mean that she has left England?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever to return.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the papers?â\\x80\\x9d asked the King hoarsely. â\\x80\\x9cAll is lost.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe shall see.â\\x80\\x9d He pushed past the servant and rushed into the\\ndrawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was\\nscattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open\\ndrawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight.\\nHolmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and,\\nplunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The\\nphotograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was\\nsuperscribed to â\\x80\\x9cSherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.â\\x80\\x9d My\\nfriend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at\\nmidnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:\\n\\n    â\\x80\\x9cMY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,â\\x80\\x94You really did it very well. You took\\n    me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a\\n    suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I\\n    began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had\\n    been told that, if the King employed an agent, it would certainly\\n    be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you\\n    made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became\\n    suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old\\n    clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself.\\n    Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the\\n    freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you,\\n    ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came\\n    down just as you departed.\\n\\n    â\\x80\\x9cWell, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was\\n    really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes.\\n    Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for\\n    the Temple to see my husband.\\n\\n    â\\x80\\x9cWe both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so\\n    formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you\\n    call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in\\n    peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do\\n    what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly\\n    wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a\\n    weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might\\n    take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to\\n    possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\\n\\n\\n    â\\x80\\x9cVery truly yours,\\n\\n    â\\x80\\x9cIRENE NORTON, _nÃ©e_ ADLER.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat a womanâ\\x80\\x94oh, what a woman!â\\x80\\x9d cried the King of Bohemia, when we had\\nall three read this epistle. â\\x80\\x9cDid I not tell you how quick and resolute\\nshe was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity\\nthat she was not on my level?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFrom what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very\\ndifferent level to your Majesty,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes coldly. â\\x80\\x9cI am sorry that\\nI have not been able to bring your Majestyâ\\x80\\x99s business to a more\\nsuccessful conclusion.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn the contrary, my dear sir,â\\x80\\x9d cried the King; â\\x80\\x9cnothing could be more\\nsuccessful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as\\nsafe as if it were in the fire.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am glad to hear your Majesty say so.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward\\nyou. This ringâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and\\nheld it out upon the palm of his hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have but to name it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis photograph!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe King stared at him in amazement.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIreneâ\\x80\\x99s photograph!â\\x80\\x9d he cried. â\\x80\\x9cCertainly, if you wish it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter.\\nI have the honour to wish you a very good morning.â\\x80\\x9d He bowed, and,\\nturning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched\\nout to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.\\n\\nAnd that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of\\nBohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a\\nwomanâ\\x80\\x99s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I\\nhave not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or\\nwhen he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable\\ntitle of _the_ woman.\\n\\n\\n\\nII. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE\\n\\n\\n I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the\\n autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very\\n stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an\\n apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled\\n me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,â\\x80\\x9d he\\nsaid cordially.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was afraid that you were engaged.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo I am. Very much so.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen I can wait in the next room.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper\\nin many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will\\nbe of the utmost use to me in yours also.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of\\ngreeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small\\nfat-encircled eyes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTry the settee,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting\\nhis fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. â\\x80\\x9cI\\nknow, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and\\noutside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have\\nshown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to\\nchronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish\\nso many of my own little adventures.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,â\\x80\\x9d I\\nobserved.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went\\ninto the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that\\nfor strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life\\nitself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the\\nimagination.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for\\notherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your\\nreason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr.\\nJabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning,\\nand to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular\\nwhich I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that\\nthe strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with\\nthe larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where\\nthere is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed.\\nAs far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the\\npresent case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events\\nis certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.\\nPerhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence\\nyour narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has\\nnot heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the\\nstory makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As\\na rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of\\nevents, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar\\ncases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to\\nadmit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some\\nlittle pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside\\npocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement column,\\nwith his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee,\\nI took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my\\ncompanion, to read the indications which might be presented by his\\ndress or appearance.\\n\\nI did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore\\nevery mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese,\\npompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherdâ\\x80\\x99s check trousers,\\na not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab\\nwaistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of\\nmetal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown\\novercoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him.\\nAltogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man\\nsave his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and\\ndiscontent upon his features.\\n\\nSherlock Holmesâ\\x80\\x99 quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head\\nwith a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. â\\x80\\x9cBeyond the obvious\\nfacts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff,\\nthat he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done\\na considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the\\npaper, but his eyes upon my companion.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?â\\x80\\x9d\\nhe asked. â\\x80\\x9cHow did you know, for example, that I did manual labour.\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s as true as gospel, for I began as a shipâ\\x80\\x99s carpenter.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than\\nyour left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more\\ndeveloped.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wonâ\\x80\\x99t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,\\nespecially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use\\nan arc-and-compass breastpin.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five\\ninches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you\\nrest it upon the desk?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, but China?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist\\ncould only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo\\nmarks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That\\ntrick of staining the fishesâ\\x80\\x99 scales of a delicate pink is quite\\npeculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from\\nyour watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. â\\x80\\x9cWell, I never!â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cI thought\\nat first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was\\nnothing in it after all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI begin to think, Watson,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, â\\x80\\x9cthat I make a mistake in\\nexplaining. â\\x80\\x98_Omne ignotum pro magnifico_,â\\x80\\x99 you know, and my poor\\nlittle reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so\\ncandid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I have got it now,â\\x80\\x9d he answered with his thick red finger planted\\nhalfway down the column. â\\x80\\x9cHere it is. This is what began it all. You\\njust read it for yourself, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI took the paper from him and read as follows:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late\\nEzekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., there is now another\\nvacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of Â£ 4 a\\nweek for purely nominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in\\nbody and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible.\\nApply in person on Monday, at eleven oâ\\x80\\x99clock, to Duncan Ross, at the\\noffices of the League, 7 Popeâ\\x80\\x99s Court, Fleet Street.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat on earth does this mean?â\\x80\\x9d I ejaculated after I had twice read\\nover the extraordinary announcement.\\n\\nHolmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in\\nhigh spirits. â\\x80\\x9cIt is a little off the beaten track, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d said he.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about\\nyourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had\\nupon your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper\\nand the date.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is _The Morning Chronicle_ of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery good. Now, Mr. Wilson?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; â\\x80\\x9cI have a small pawnbrokerâ\\x80\\x99s\\nbusiness at Coburg Square, near the City. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not a very large affair,\\nand of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I\\nused to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I\\nwould have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half\\nwages so as to learn the business.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is the name of this obliging youth?â\\x80\\x9d asked Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHis name is Vincent Spaulding, and heâ\\x80\\x99s not such a youth, either. Itâ\\x80\\x99s\\nhard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes;\\nand I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I\\nam able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I\\nput ideas in his head?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an _employÃ©_ who comes\\nunder the full market price. It is not a common experience among\\nemployers in this age. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know that your assistant is not as\\nremarkable as your advertisement.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, he has his faults, too,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Wilson. â\\x80\\x9cNever was such a fellow\\nfor photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be\\nimproving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit\\ninto its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on\\nthe whole heâ\\x80\\x99s a good worker. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s no vice in him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe is still with you, I presume?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking\\nand keeps the place cleanâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s all I have in the house, for I am a\\nwidower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three\\nof us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do\\nnothing more.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he\\ncame down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very\\npaper in his hand, and he says:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Why that?â\\x80\\x99 I asks.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Why,â\\x80\\x99 says he, â\\x80\\x98hereâ\\x80\\x99s another vacancy on the League of the\\nRed-headed Men. Itâ\\x80\\x99s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets\\nit, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men,\\nso that the trustees are at their witsâ\\x80\\x99 end what to do with the money.\\nIf my hair would only change colour, hereâ\\x80\\x99s a nice little crib all\\nready for me to step into.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Why, what is it, then?â\\x80\\x99 I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very\\nstay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to\\ngo to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the\\ndoor-mat. In that way I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know much of what was going on outside,\\nand I was always glad of a bit of news.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?â\\x80\\x99 he asked\\nwith his eyes open.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Never.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the\\nvacancies.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98And what are they worth?â\\x80\\x99 I asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it\\nneed not interfere very much with oneâ\\x80\\x99s other occupations.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the\\nbusiness has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of\\nhundred would have been very handy.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Tell me all about it,â\\x80\\x99 said I.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 said he, showing me the advertisement, â\\x80\\x98you can see for\\nyourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where\\nyou should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League\\nwas founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very\\npeculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great\\nsympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he\\nhad left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with\\ninstructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to\\nmen whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay\\nand very little to do.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98But,â\\x80\\x99 said I, â\\x80\\x98there would be millions of red-headed men who would\\napply.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Not so many as you might think,â\\x80\\x99 he answered. â\\x80\\x98You see it is really\\nconfined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from\\nLondon when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn.\\nThen, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is\\nlight red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery\\nred. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in;\\nbut perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of\\nthe way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my\\nhair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if\\nthere was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance\\nas any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so\\nmuch about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered\\nhim to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me.\\nHe was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and\\nstarted off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From\\nnorth, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his\\nhair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet\\nStreet was choked with red-headed folk, and Popeâ\\x80\\x99s Court looked like a\\ncosterâ\\x80\\x99s orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in\\nthe whole country as were brought together by that single\\nadvertisement. Every shade of colour they wereâ\\x80\\x94straw, lemon, orange,\\nbrick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were\\nnot many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how\\nmany were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding\\nwould not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed\\nand pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up\\nto the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon\\nthe stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we\\nwedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour experience has been a most entertaining one,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Holmes as\\nhis client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPray continue your very interesting statement.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a\\ndeal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even\\nredder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came up,\\nand then he always managed to find some fault in them which would\\ndisqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy\\nmatter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much\\nmore favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door\\nas we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,â\\x80\\x99 said my assistant, â\\x80\\x98and he is willing to\\nfill a vacancy in the League.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98And he is admirably suited for it,â\\x80\\x99 the other answered. â\\x80\\x98He has every\\nrequirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.â\\x80\\x99 He\\ntook a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair\\nuntil I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my\\nhand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98It would be injustice to hesitate,â\\x80\\x99 said he. â\\x80\\x98You will, however, I am\\nsure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.â\\x80\\x99 With that he seized\\nmy hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain.\\nâ\\x80\\x98There is water in your eyes,â\\x80\\x99 said he as he released me. â\\x80\\x98I perceive\\nthat all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have\\ntwice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales\\nof cobblerâ\\x80\\x99s wax which would disgust you with human nature.â\\x80\\x99 He stepped\\nover to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that\\nthe vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below,\\nand the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was\\nnot a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98My name,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the\\npensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a\\nmarried man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI answered that I had not.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHis face fell immediately.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Dear me!â\\x80\\x99 he said gravely, â\\x80\\x98that is very serious indeed! I am sorry\\nto hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and\\nspread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is\\nexceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not\\nto have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few\\nminutes he said that it would be all right.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98In the case of another,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98the objection might be fatal, but\\nwe must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as\\nyours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,â\\x80\\x99 said I.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!â\\x80\\x99 said Vincent Spaulding. â\\x80\\x98I\\nshould be able to look after that for you.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98What would be the hours?â\\x80\\x99 I asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Ten to two.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow a pawnbrokerâ\\x80\\x99s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes,\\nespecially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day;\\nso it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings.\\nBesides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see\\nto anything that turned up.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98That would suit me very well,â\\x80\\x99 said I. â\\x80\\x98And the pay?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Is Â£ 4 a week.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98And the work?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Is purely nominal.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98What do you call purely nominal?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the\\nwhole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The\\nwill is very clear upon that point. You donâ\\x80\\x99t comply with the\\nconditions if you budge from the office during that time.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,â\\x80\\x99 said\\nI.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98No excuse will avail,â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Duncan Ross; â\\x80\\x98neither sickness nor\\nbusiness nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your\\nbillet.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98And the work?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Is to copy out the _EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica_. There is the first\\nvolume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and\\nblotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready\\nto-morrow?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Certainly,â\\x80\\x99 I answered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once\\nmore on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to\\ngain.â\\x80\\x99 He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant,\\nhardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good\\nfortune.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low\\nspirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair\\nmust be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I\\ncould not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could\\nmake such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything\\nso simple as copying out the _EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica_. Vincent\\nSpaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had\\nreasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I\\ndetermined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of\\nink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I\\nstarted off for Popeâ\\x80\\x99s Court.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible.\\nThe table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to\\nsee that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and\\nthen he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all\\nwas right with me. At two oâ\\x80\\x99clock he bade me good-day, complimented me\\nupon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office\\nafter me.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager\\ncame in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my weekâ\\x80\\x99s work. It\\nwas the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I\\nwas there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr.\\nDuncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a\\ntime, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to\\nleave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come,\\nand the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would\\nnot risk the loss of it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and\\nArchery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with\\ndiligence that I might get on to the Bâ\\x80\\x99s before very long. It cost me\\nsomething in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my\\nwritings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo an end?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual\\nat ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square\\nof cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here\\nit is, and you can read for yourself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of\\nnote-paper. It read in this fashion:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED. October 9, 1890.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful\\nface behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely\\novertopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar\\nof laughter.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI cannot see that there is anything very funny,â\\x80\\x9d cried our client,\\nflushing up to the roots of his flaming head. â\\x80\\x9cIf you can do nothing\\nbetter than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no,â\\x80\\x9d cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he\\nhad half risen. â\\x80\\x9cI really wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t miss your case for the world. It is\\nmost refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying\\nso, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you\\ntake when you found the card upon the door?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the\\noffices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.\\nFinally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the\\nground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of\\nthe Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such\\nbody. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the\\nname was new to him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 said I, â\\x80\\x98the gentleman at No. 4.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98What, the red-headed man?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Yes.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Oh,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and\\nwas using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises\\nwere ready. He moved out yesterday.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Where could I find him?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King\\nEdward Street, near St. Paulâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a\\nmanufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of\\neither Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd what did you do then?â\\x80\\x9d asked Holmes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my\\nassistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that\\nif I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough,\\nMr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so,\\nas I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk\\nwho were in need of it, I came right away to you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you did very wisely,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes. â\\x80\\x9cYour case is an exceedingly\\nremarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you\\nhave told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from\\nit than might at first sight appear.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGrave enough!â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jabez Wilson. â\\x80\\x9cWhy, I have lost four pound a\\nweek.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs far as you are personally concerned,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Holmes, â\\x80\\x9cI do not\\nsee that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On\\nthe contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some Â£ 30, to say\\nnothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject\\nwhich comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what\\ntheir object was in playing this prankâ\\x80\\x94if it was a prankâ\\x80\\x94upon me. It\\nwas a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty\\npounds.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one\\nor two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called\\nyour attention to the advertisementâ\\x80\\x94how long had he been with you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbout a month then.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow did he come?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn answer to an advertisement.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWas he the only applicant?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I had a dozen.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy did you pick him?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause he was handy and would come cheap.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt half wages, in fact.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSmall, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,\\nthough heâ\\x80\\x99s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his\\nforehead.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHolmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. â\\x80\\x9cI thought as\\nmuch,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cHave you ever observed that his ears are pierced for\\nearrings?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a\\nlad.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHum!â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. â\\x80\\x9cHe is still with\\nyou?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd has your business been attended to in your absence?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNothing to complain of, sir. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s never very much to do of a\\nmorning.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon\\nthe subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I\\nhope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, Watson,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes when our visitor had left us, â\\x80\\x9cwhat do you\\nmake of it all?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI make nothing of it,â\\x80\\x9d I answered frankly. â\\x80\\x9cIt is a most mysterious\\nbusiness.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs a rule,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, â\\x80\\x9cthe more bizarre a thing is the less\\nmysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes\\nwhich are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most\\ndifficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat are you going to do, then?â\\x80\\x9d I asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo smoke,â\\x80\\x9d he answered. â\\x80\\x9cIt is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg\\nthat you wonâ\\x80\\x99t speak to me for fifty minutes.â\\x80\\x9d He curled himself up in\\nhis chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and\\nthere he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out\\nlike the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that\\nhe had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly\\nsprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his\\nmind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSarasate plays at the St. Jamesâ\\x80\\x99s Hall this afternoon,â\\x80\\x9d he remarked.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few\\nhours?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and\\nwe can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal\\nof German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than\\nItalian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come\\nalong!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk\\ntook us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we\\nhad listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel\\nplace, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out\\ninto a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few\\nclumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden\\nand uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJABEZ WILSONâ\\x80\\x9d in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the\\nplace where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock\\nHolmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it\\nall over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he\\nwalked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still\\nlooking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbrokerâ\\x80\\x99s,\\nand, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or\\nthree times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly\\nopened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to\\nstep in.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, â\\x80\\x9cI only wished to ask you how you would go\\nfrom here to the Strand.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThird right, fourth left,â\\x80\\x9d answered the assistant promptly, closing\\nthe door.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSmart fellow, that,â\\x80\\x9d observed Holmes as we walked away. â\\x80\\x9cHe is, in my\\njudgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not\\nsure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him\\nbefore.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEvidently,â\\x80\\x9d said I, â\\x80\\x9cMr. Wilsonâ\\x80\\x99s assistant counts for a good deal in\\nthis mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your\\nway merely in order that you might see him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe knees of his trousers.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd what did you see?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat I expected to see.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy did you beat the pavement?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are\\nspies in an enemyâ\\x80\\x99s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square.\\nLet us now explore the parts which lie behind it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from\\nthe retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as\\nthe front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main\\narteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west.\\nThe roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in\\na double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with\\nthe hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we\\nlooked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that\\nthey really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant\\nsquare which we had just quitted.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet me see,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along\\nthe line, â\\x80\\x9cI should like just to remember the order of the houses here.\\nIt is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is\\nMortimerâ\\x80\\x99s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg\\nbranch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and\\nMcFarlaneâ\\x80\\x99s carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the\\nother block. And now, Doctor, weâ\\x80\\x99ve done our work, so itâ\\x80\\x99s time we had\\nsome play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land,\\nwhere all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no\\nred-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMy friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very\\ncapable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the\\nafternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness,\\ngently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his\\ngently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those\\nof Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted,\\nready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his\\nsingular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his\\nextreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought,\\nthe reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which\\noccasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from\\nextreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never\\nso truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in\\nhis armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions.\\nThen it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him,\\nand that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of\\nintuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would\\nlook askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other\\nmortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St.\\nJamesâ\\x80\\x99s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom\\nhe had set himself to hunt down.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,â\\x80\\x9d he remarked as we emerged.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, it would be as well.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd I have some business to do which will take some hours. This\\nbusiness at Coburg Square is serious.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy serious?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to\\nbelieve that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday\\nrather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt what time?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTen will be early enough.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI shall be at Baker Street at ten.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so\\nkindly put your army revolver in your pocket.â\\x80\\x9d He waved his hand,\\nturned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.\\n\\nI trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always\\noppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock\\nHolmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had\\nseen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not\\nonly what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the\\nwhole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my\\nhouse in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story\\nof the red-headed copier of the _EncyclopÃ¦dia_ down to the visit to\\nSaxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from\\nme. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?\\nWhere were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes\\nthat this smooth-faced pawnbrokerâ\\x80\\x99s assistant was a formidable manâ\\x80\\x94a\\nman who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it\\nup in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an\\nexplanation.\\n\\nIt was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way\\nacross the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two\\nhansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard\\nthe sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in\\nanimated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter\\nJones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin,\\nsad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable\\nfrock-coat.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHa! Our party is complete,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket\\nand taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. â\\x80\\x9cWatson, I think you\\nknow Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr.\\nMerryweather, who is to be our companion in to-nightâ\\x80\\x99s adventure.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,â\\x80\\x9d said Jones in his\\nconsequential way. â\\x80\\x9cOur friend here is a wonderful man for starting a\\nchase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,â\\x80\\x9d\\nobserved Mr. Merryweather gloomily.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\npolice agent loftily. â\\x80\\x9cHe has his own little methods, which are, if he\\nwonâ\\x80\\x99t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic,\\nbut he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say\\nthat once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the\\nAgra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official\\nforce.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,â\\x80\\x9d said the stranger with\\ndeference. â\\x80\\x9cStill, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first\\nSaturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my\\nrubber.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think you will find,â\\x80\\x9d said Sherlock Holmes, â\\x80\\x9cthat you will play for\\na higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play\\nwill be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be\\nsome Â£ 30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you\\nwish to lay your hands.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJohn Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. Heâ\\x80\\x99s a young man,\\nMr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would\\nrather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. Heâ\\x80\\x99s a\\nremarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke,\\nand he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as\\nhis fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never\\nknow where to find the man himself. Heâ\\x80\\x99ll crack a crib in Scotland one\\nweek, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve\\nhad one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with\\nyou that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however,\\nand quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom,\\nWatson and I will follow in the second.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and\\nlay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the\\nafternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets\\nuntil we emerged into Farrington Street.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe are close there now,â\\x80\\x9d my friend remarked. â\\x80\\x9cThis fellow Merryweather\\nis a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought\\nit as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though\\nan absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He\\nis as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his\\nclaws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found\\nourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the\\nguidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and\\nthrough a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small\\ncorridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was\\nopened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated\\nat another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a\\nlantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and\\nso, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was\\npiled all round with crates and massive boxes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are not very vulnerable from above,â\\x80\\x9d Holmes remarked as he held up\\nthe lantern and gazed about him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNor from below,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the\\nflags which lined the floor. â\\x80\\x9cWhy, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!â\\x80\\x9d he\\nremarked, looking up in surprise.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI must really ask you to be a little more quiet!â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes\\nseverely. â\\x80\\x9cYou have already imperilled the whole success of our\\nexpedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down\\nupon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very\\ninjured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon\\nthe floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine\\nminutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to\\nsatisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his\\npocket.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe have at least an hour before us,â\\x80\\x9d he remarked, â\\x80\\x9cfor they can hardly\\ntake any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they\\nwill not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer\\ntime they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctorâ\\x80\\x94as no\\ndoubt you have divinedâ\\x80\\x94in the cellar of the City branch of one of the\\nprincipal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors,\\nand he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring\\ncriminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar\\nat present.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is our French gold,â\\x80\\x9d whispered the director. â\\x80\\x9cWe have had several\\nwarnings that an attempt might be made upon it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour French gold?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and\\nborrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It\\nhas become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money,\\nand that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit\\ncontains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our\\nreserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a\\nsingle branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the\\nsubject.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhich were very well justified,â\\x80\\x9d observed Holmes. â\\x80\\x9cAnd now it is time\\nthat we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters\\nwill come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the\\nscreen over that dark lantern.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd sit in the dark?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I\\nthought that, as we were a _partie carrÃ©e_, you might have your rubber\\nafter all. But I see that the enemyâ\\x80\\x99s preparations have gone so far\\nthat we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must\\nchoose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take\\nthem at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful.\\nI shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind\\nthose. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they\\nfire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind\\nwhich I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern\\nand left us in pitch darknessâ\\x80\\x94such an absolute darkness as I have never\\nbefore experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that\\nthe light was still there, ready to flash out at a momentâ\\x80\\x99s notice. To\\nme, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was\\nsomething depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold\\ndank air of the vault.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey have but one retreat,â\\x80\\x9d whispered Holmes. â\\x80\\x9cThat is back through\\nthe house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I\\nasked you, Jones?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and\\nwait.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWhat a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an\\nhour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have\\nalmost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and\\nstiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up\\nto the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I\\ncould not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could\\ndistinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the\\nthin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look\\nover the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught\\nthe glint of a light.\\n\\nAt first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it\\nlengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any\\nwarning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white,\\nalmost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area\\nof light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers,\\nprotruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it\\nappeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which\\nmarked a chink between the stones.\\n\\nIts disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing\\nsound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and\\nleft a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a\\nlantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which\\nlooked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the\\naperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee\\nrested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the\\nhole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like\\nhimself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s all clear,â\\x80\\x9d he whispered. â\\x80\\x9cHave you the chisel and the bags?\\nGreat Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll swing for it!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar.\\nThe other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth\\nas Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a\\nrevolver, but Holmesâ\\x80\\x99 hunting crop came down on the manâ\\x80\\x99s wrist, and\\nthe pistol clinked upon the stone floor.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s no use, John Clay,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes blandly. â\\x80\\x9cYou have no chance at\\nall.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo I see,â\\x80\\x9d the other answered with the utmost coolness. â\\x80\\x9cI fancy that\\nmy pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere are three men waiting for him at the door,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must\\ncompliment you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd I you,â\\x80\\x9d Holmes answered. â\\x80\\x9cYour red-headed idea was very new and\\neffective.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll see your pal again presently,â\\x80\\x9d said Jones. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s quicker at\\nclimbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,â\\x80\\x9d remarked our\\nprisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. â\\x80\\x9cYou may not be\\naware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also,\\nwhen you address me always to say â\\x80\\x98sirâ\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98please.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll right,â\\x80\\x9d said Jones with a stare and a snigger. â\\x80\\x9cWell, would you\\nplease, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your\\nHighness to the police-station?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is better,â\\x80\\x9d said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to\\nthe three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cReally, Mr. Holmes,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from\\nthe cellar, â\\x80\\x9cI do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.\\nThere is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most\\ncomplete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery\\nthat have ever come within my experience.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John\\nClay,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes. â\\x80\\x9cI have been at some small expense over this\\nmatter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am\\namply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique,\\nand by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou see, Watson,â\\x80\\x9d he explained in the early hours of the morning as we\\nsat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, â\\x80\\x9cit was perfectly\\nobvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather\\nfantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying\\nof the _EncyclopÃ¦dia_, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker\\nout of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of\\nmanaging it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better.\\nThe method was no doubt suggested to Clayâ\\x80\\x99s ingenious mind by the\\ncolour of his accompliceâ\\x80\\x99s hair. The Â£ 4 a week was a lure which must\\ndraw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They\\nput in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other\\nrogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to\\nsecure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I\\nheard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me\\nthat he had some strong motive for securing the situation.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut how could you guess what the motive was?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHad there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere\\nvulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The manâ\\x80\\x99s\\nbusiness was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which\\ncould account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure\\nas they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What\\ncould it be? I thought of the assistantâ\\x80\\x99s fondness for photography, and\\nhis trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end\\nof this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious\\nassistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most\\ndaring criminals in London. He was doing something in the\\ncellarâ\\x80\\x94something which took many hours a day for months on end. What\\ncould it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was\\nrunning a tunnel to some other building.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I\\nsurprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was\\nascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It\\nwas not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant\\nanswered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes\\nupon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were\\nwhat I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn,\\nwrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of\\nburrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I\\nwalked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our\\nfriendâ\\x80\\x99s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you\\ndrove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the\\nchairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?â\\x80\\x9d I\\nasked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they\\ncared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilsonâ\\x80\\x99s presenceâ\\x80\\x94in other words, that\\nthey had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should\\nuse it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be\\nremoved. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it\\nwould give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I\\nexpected them to come to-night.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou reasoned it out beautifully,â\\x80\\x9d I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt saved me from ennui,â\\x80\\x9d he answered, yawning. â\\x80\\x9cAlas! I already feel\\nit closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape\\nfrom the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do\\nso.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you are a benefactor of the race,â\\x80\\x9d said I.\\n\\nHe shrugged his shoulders. â\\x80\\x9cWell, perhaps, after all, it is of some\\nlittle use,â\\x80\\x9d he remarked. â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98_Lâ\\x80\\x99homme câ\\x80\\x99est rienâ\\x80\\x94lâ\\x80\\x99Å\\x93uvre câ\\x80\\x99est tout_,â\\x80\\x99\\nas Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\nIII. A CASE OF IDENTITY\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear fellow,â\\x80\\x9d said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the\\nfire in his lodgings at Baker Street, â\\x80\\x9clife is infinitely stranger than\\nanything which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to\\nconceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If\\nwe could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great\\ncity, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which\\nare going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the\\ncross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through\\ngenerations, and leading to the most _outrÃ©_ results, it would make all\\nfiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale\\nand unprofitable.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd yet I am not convinced of it,â\\x80\\x9d I answered. â\\x80\\x9cThe cases which come\\nto light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough.\\nWe have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and\\nyet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor\\nartistic.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a\\nrealistic effect,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Holmes. â\\x80\\x9cThis is wanting in the police\\nreport, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the\\nmagistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the\\nvital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so\\nunnatural as the commonplace.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI smiled and shook my head. â\\x80\\x9cI can quite understand your thinking so,â\\x80\\x9d\\nI said. â\\x80\\x9cOf course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper\\nto everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents,\\nyou are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But\\nhereâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94I picked up the morning paper from the groundâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9clet us put it to a\\npractical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. â\\x80\\x98A\\nhusbandâ\\x80\\x99s cruelty to his wife.â\\x80\\x99 There is half a column of print, but I\\nknow without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There\\nis, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the\\nbruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers\\ncould invent nothing more crude.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIndeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nHolmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. â\\x80\\x9cThis is the\\nDundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing\\nup some small points in connection with it. The husband was a\\nteetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was\\nthat he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking\\nout his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will\\nallow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the\\naverage story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge\\nthat I have scored over you in your example.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the\\ncentre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely\\nways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cI forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is\\na little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance\\nin the case of the Irene Adler papers.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the ring?â\\x80\\x9d I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which\\nsparkled upon his finger.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which\\nI served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to\\nyou, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little\\nproblems.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd have you any on hand just now?â\\x80\\x9d I asked with interest.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSome ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest.\\nThey are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed,\\nI have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a\\nfield for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and\\neffect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are\\napt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a\\nrule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate\\nmatter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing\\nwhich presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that\\nI may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this\\nis one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds\\ngazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over\\nhis shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large\\nwoman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red\\nfeather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess\\nof Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she\\npeeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her\\nbody oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her\\nglove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves\\nthe bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of\\nthe bell.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have seen those symptoms before,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, throwing his\\ncigarette into the fire. â\\x80\\x9cOscillation upon the pavement always means an\\n_affaire de cÅ\\x93ur_. She would like advice, but is not sure that the\\nmatter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may\\ndiscriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no\\nlonger oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we\\nmay take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so\\nmuch angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to\\nresolve our doubts.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered\\nto announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind\\nhis small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny\\npilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for\\nwhich he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into\\nan armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted\\nfashion which was peculiar to him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you not find,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cthat with your short sight it is a little\\ntrying to do so much typewriting?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI did at first,â\\x80\\x9d she answered, â\\x80\\x9cbut now I know where the letters are\\nwithout looking.â\\x80\\x9d Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his\\nwords, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and\\nastonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve heard about\\nme, Mr. Holmes,â\\x80\\x9d she cried, â\\x80\\x9celse how could you know all that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever mind,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, laughing; â\\x80\\x9cit is my business to know things.\\nPerhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why\\nshould you come to consult me?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose\\nhusband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up\\nfor dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. Iâ\\x80\\x99m not\\nrich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the\\nlittle that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what\\nhas become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?â\\x80\\x9d asked Sherlock\\nHolmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.\\n\\nAgain a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary\\nSutherland. â\\x80\\x9cYes, I did bang out of the house,â\\x80\\x9d she said, â\\x80\\x9cfor it made\\nme angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibankâ\\x80\\x94that is, my\\nfatherâ\\x80\\x94took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go\\nto you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that\\nthere was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things\\nand came right away to you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour father,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, â\\x80\\x9cyour stepfather, surely, since the name is\\ndifferent.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too,\\nfor he is only five years and two months older than myself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd your mother is alive?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t best pleased, Mr. Holmes,\\nwhen she married again so soon after fatherâ\\x80\\x99s death, and a man who was\\nnearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the\\nTottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which\\nmother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank\\ncame he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a\\ntraveller in wines. They got Â£ 4700 for the goodwill and interest,\\nwhich wasnâ\\x80\\x99t near as much as father could have got if he had been\\nalive.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and\\ninconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with\\nthe greatest concentration of attention.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour own little income,â\\x80\\x9d he asked, â\\x80\\x9cdoes it come out of the business?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in\\nAuckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4Â½ per cent. Two thousand\\nfive hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou interest me extremely,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes. â\\x80\\x9cAnd since you draw so large\\na sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no\\ndoubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that\\na single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about Â£ 60.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand\\nthat as long as I live at home I donâ\\x80\\x99t wish to be a burden to them, and\\nso they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of\\ncourse, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest\\nevery quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do\\npretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a\\nsheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have made your position very clear to me,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes. â\\x80\\x9cThis is\\nmy friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before\\nmyself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer\\nAngel.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA flush stole over Miss Sutherlandâ\\x80\\x99s face, and she picked nervously at\\nthe fringe of her jacket. â\\x80\\x9cI met him first at the gasfittersâ\\x80\\x99 ball,â\\x80\\x9d\\nshe said. â\\x80\\x9cThey used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then\\nafterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank\\ndid not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would\\nget quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But\\nthis time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to\\nprevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all\\nfatherâ\\x80\\x99s friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit\\nto wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken\\nout of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to\\nFrance upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with\\nMr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr.\\nHosmer Angel.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI suppose,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, â\\x80\\x9cthat when Mr. Windibank came back from\\nFrance he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and\\nshrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a\\nwoman, for she would have her way.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see. Then at the gasfittersâ\\x80\\x99 ball you met, as I understand, a\\ngentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we\\nhad got home all safe, and after that we met himâ\\x80\\x94that is to say, Mr.\\nHolmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back\\nagain, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, you know father didnâ\\x80\\x99t like anything of the sort. He wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t\\nhave any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman\\nshould be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to\\nmother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got\\nmine yet.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote\\nand said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until\\nhe had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every\\nday. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for\\nfather to know.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWere you engaged to the gentleman at this time?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we\\ntook. Hosmerâ\\x80\\x94Mr. Angelâ\\x80\\x94was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall\\nStreetâ\\x80\\x94andâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat office?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere did he live, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe slept on the premises.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you donâ\\x80\\x99t know his address?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNoâ\\x80\\x94except that it was Leadenhall Street.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere did you address your letters, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He\\nsaid that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all\\nthe other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to\\ntypewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have that, for he said\\nthat when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were\\ntypewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. That\\nwill just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little\\nthings that he would think of.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was most suggestive,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes. â\\x80\\x9cIt has long been an axiom of\\nmine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you\\nremember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the\\nevening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be\\nconspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was\\ngentle. Heâ\\x80\\x99d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he\\ntold me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating,\\nwhispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and\\nplain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted\\nglasses against the glare.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned\\nto France?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should\\nmarry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me\\nswear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would\\nalways be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear,\\nand that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour\\nfrom the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they\\ntalked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but\\nthey both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him\\nafterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I\\ndidnâ\\x80\\x99t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask\\nhis leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didnâ\\x80\\x99t want\\nto do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the\\ncompany has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the\\nvery morning of the wedding.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt missed him, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHa! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the\\nFriday. Was it to be in church?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviourâ\\x80\\x99s, near Kingâ\\x80\\x99s\\nCross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras\\nHotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he\\nput us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which\\nhappened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church\\nfirst, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step\\nout, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and\\nlooked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not\\nimagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own\\neyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard\\nanything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nHolmes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the\\nmorning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true;\\nand that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I\\nwas always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would\\nclaim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a\\nwedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMost certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some\\nunforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not\\nhave talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you have no notion as to what it could have been?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNone.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne more question. How did your mother take the matter?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter\\nagain.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd your father? Did you tell him?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and\\nthat I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could\\nanyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving\\nme? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got\\nmy money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was\\nvery independent about money and never would look at a shilling of\\nmine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write?\\nOh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I canâ\\x80\\x99t sleep a wink at\\nnight.â\\x80\\x9d She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to\\nsob heavily into it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI shall glance into the case for you,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, rising, â\\x80\\x9cand I\\nhave no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight\\nof the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it\\nfurther. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your\\nmemory, as he has done from your life.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you donâ\\x80\\x99t think Iâ\\x80\\x99ll see him again?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI fear not.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen what has happened to him?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate\\ndescription of him and any letters of his which you can spare.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI advertised for him in last Saturdayâ\\x80\\x99s _Chronicle_,â\\x80\\x9d said she. â\\x80\\x9cHere\\nis the slip and here are four letters from him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you. And your address?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Angelâ\\x80\\x99s address you never had, I understand. Where is your\\nfatherâ\\x80\\x99s place of business?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of\\nFenchurch Street.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave\\nthe papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let\\nthe whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your\\nlife.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true\\nto Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFor all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something\\nnoble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect.\\nShe laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way,\\nwith a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still\\npressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze\\ndirected upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old\\nand oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit\\nit, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths\\nspinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite an interesting study, that maiden,â\\x80\\x9d he observed. â\\x80\\x9cI found her\\nmore interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather\\na trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in\\nAndover in â\\x80\\x9977, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last\\nyear. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which\\nwere new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to\\nme,â\\x80\\x9d I remarked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look,\\nand so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to\\nrealise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails,\\nor the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you\\ngather from that womanâ\\x80\\x99s appearance? Describe it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a\\nfeather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn\\nupon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was\\nbrown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at\\nthe neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at\\nthe right forefinger. Her boots I didnâ\\x80\\x99t observe. She had small round,\\nhanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in\\na vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x99Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have\\nreally done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed\\neverything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you\\nhave a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my\\nboy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always\\nat a womanâ\\x80\\x99s sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the\\nknee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her\\nsleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double\\nline a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against\\nthe table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand\\ntype, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side\\nof it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the\\nbroadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing\\nthe dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark\\nupon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt surprised me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested\\non glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was\\nwearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one\\nhaving a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was\\nbuttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at\\nthe first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady,\\notherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots,\\nhalf-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a\\nhurry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd what else?â\\x80\\x9d I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my\\nfriendâ\\x80\\x99s incisive reasoning.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home\\nbut after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was\\ntorn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove\\nand finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and\\ndipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark\\nwould not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though\\nrather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you\\nmind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI held the little printed slip to the light. â\\x80\\x9cMissing,â\\x80\\x9d it said, â\\x80\\x9con\\nthe morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About\\nfive ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black\\nhair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and\\nmoustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed,\\nwhen last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat,\\ngold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters\\nover elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in\\nLeadenhall Street. Anybody bringing,â\\x80\\x9d &c, &c.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat will do,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes. â\\x80\\x9cAs to the letters,â\\x80\\x9d he continued,\\nglancing over them, â\\x80\\x9cthey are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in\\nthem to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one\\nremarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey are typewritten,â\\x80\\x9d I remarked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat\\nlittle â\\x80\\x98Hosmer Angelâ\\x80\\x99 at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no\\nsuperscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The\\npoint about the signature is very suggestiveâ\\x80\\x94in fact, we may call it\\nconclusive.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf what?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears\\nupon the case?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to\\ndeny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which\\nshould settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to\\nthe young ladyâ\\x80\\x99s stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could\\nmeet us here at six oâ\\x80\\x99clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well that\\nwe should do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can\\ndo nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our\\nlittle problem upon the shelf for the interim.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI had had so many reasons to believe in my friendâ\\x80\\x99s subtle powers of\\nreasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must\\nhave some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which\\nhe treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to\\nfathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of\\nBohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to\\nthe weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary\\ncircumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would\\nbe a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.\\n\\nI left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the\\nconviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that\\nhe held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity\\nof the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.\\n\\nA professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at\\nthe time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the\\nsufferer. It was not until close upon six oâ\\x80\\x99clock that I found myself\\nfree and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street,\\nhalf afraid that I might be too late to assist at the _dÃ©nouement_ of\\nthe little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half\\nasleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his\\narmchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the\\npungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent\\nhis day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, have you solved it?â\\x80\\x9d I asked as I entered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, the mystery!â\\x80\\x9d I cried.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There\\nwas never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some\\nof the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no\\nlaw, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss\\nSutherland?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened\\nhis lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a\\ntap at the door.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is the girlâ\\x80\\x99s stepfather, Mr. James Windibank,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes. â\\x80\\x9cHe\\nhas written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty\\nyears of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland,\\ninsinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating\\ngrey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny\\ntop-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the\\nnearest chair.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood-evening, Mr. James Windibank,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes. â\\x80\\x9cI think that this\\ntypewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with\\nme for six oâ\\x80\\x99clock?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my\\nown master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you\\nabout this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash\\nlinen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she\\ncame, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have\\nnoticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind\\non a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not\\nconnected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a\\nfamily misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless\\nexpense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn the contrary,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes quietly; â\\x80\\x9cI have every reason to believe\\nthat I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. â\\x80\\x9cI am\\ndelighted to hear it,â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is a curious thing,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Holmes, â\\x80\\x9cthat a typewriter has really\\nquite as much individuality as a manâ\\x80\\x99s handwriting. Unless they are\\nquite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more\\nworn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in\\nthis note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some\\nlittle slurring over of the â\\x80\\x98e,â\\x80\\x99 and a slight defect in the tail of the\\nâ\\x80\\x98r.â\\x80\\x99 There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more\\nobvious.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no\\ndoubt it is a little worn,â\\x80\\x9d our visitor answered, glancing keenly at\\nHolmes with his bright little eyes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr.\\nWindibank,â\\x80\\x9d Holmes continued. â\\x80\\x9cI think of writing another little\\nmonograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to\\ncrime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I\\nhave here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. They\\nare all typewritten. In each case, not only are the â\\x80\\x98eâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x99 slurred and\\nthe â\\x80\\x98râ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x99 tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my\\nmagnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I\\nhave alluded are there as well.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. â\\x80\\x9cI cannot\\nwaste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cIf\\nyou can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done\\nit.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the\\ndoor. â\\x80\\x9cI let you know, then, that I have caught him!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat! where?â\\x80\\x9d shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and\\nglancing about him like a rat in a trap.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, it wonâ\\x80\\x99t doâ\\x80\\x94really it wonâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes suavely. â\\x80\\x9cThere is no\\npossible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent,\\nand it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible\\nfor me to solve so simple a question. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s right! Sit down and let us\\ntalk it over.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOur visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter\\nof moisture on his brow. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s not actionable,â\\x80\\x9d he stammered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves,\\nWindibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty\\nway as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of\\nevents, and you will contradict me if I go wrong.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his\\nbreast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on\\nthe corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his\\npockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid he, â\\x80\\x9cand he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long\\nas she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their\\nposition, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It\\nwas worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable\\ndisposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it\\nwas evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little\\nincome, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her\\nmarriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what\\ndoes her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of\\nkeeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of\\nher own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She\\nbecame restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her\\npositive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever\\nstepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head\\nthan to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he\\ndisguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked\\nthe face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear\\nvoice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the\\ngirlâ\\x80\\x99s short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other\\nlovers by making love himself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was only a joke at first,â\\x80\\x9d groaned our visitor. â\\x80\\x9cWe never thought\\nthat she would have been so carried away.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very\\ndecidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her\\nstepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an\\ninstant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s\\nattentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed\\nadmiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was\\nobvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a\\nreal effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an\\nengagement, which would finally secure the girlâ\\x80\\x99s affections from\\nturning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up\\nforever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The\\nthing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a\\ndramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the\\nyoung ladyâ\\x80\\x99s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor\\nfor some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a\\nTestament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something\\nhappening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished\\nMiss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to\\nhis fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen\\nto another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as\\nhe could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick\\nof stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I\\nthink that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOur visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had\\nbeen talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his\\npale face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cbut if you are so\\nvery sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are\\nbreaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from\\nthe first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself\\nopen to an action for assault and illegal constraint.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe law cannot, as you say, touch you,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, unlocking and\\nthrowing open the door, â\\x80\\x9cyet there never was a man who deserved\\npunishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought\\nto lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!â\\x80\\x9d he continued, flushing\\nup at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the manâ\\x80\\x99s face, â\\x80\\x9cit is not\\npart of my duties to my client, but hereâ\\x80\\x99s a hunting crop handy, and I\\nthink I shall just treat myself toâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d He took two swift steps to the\\nwhip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps\\nupon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we\\ncould see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the\\nroad.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s a cold-blooded scoundrel!â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, laughing, as he threw\\nhimself down into his chair once more. â\\x80\\x9cThat fellow will rise from\\ncrime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows.\\nThe case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,â\\x80\\x9d I\\nremarked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer\\nAngel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was\\nequally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as\\nfar as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men\\nwere never together, but that the one always appeared when the other\\nwas away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious\\nvoice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My\\nsuspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his\\nsignature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so\\nfamiliar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of\\nit. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones,\\nall pointed in the same direction.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd how did you verify them?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHaving once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew\\nthe firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed\\ndescription. I eliminated everything from it which could be the result\\nof a disguiseâ\\x80\\x94the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to\\nthe firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered\\nto the description of any of their travellers. I had already noticed\\nthe peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at\\nhis business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected,\\nhis reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but\\ncharacteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from\\nWesthouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description\\ntallied in every respect with that of their employÃ©, James Windibank.\\n_VoilÃ\\xa0 tout_!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd Miss Sutherland?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old\\nPersian saying, â\\x80\\x98There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and\\ndanger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.â\\x80\\x99 There is as\\nmuch sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY\\n\\nWe were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid\\nbrought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the\\nwest of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be\\nglad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave\\nPaddington by the 11:15.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you say, dear?â\\x80\\x9d said my wife, looking across at me. â\\x80\\x9cWill you\\ngo?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI really donâ\\x80\\x99t know what to say. I have a fairly long list at\\npresent.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a\\nlittle pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you\\nare always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmesâ\\x80\\x99 cases.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one\\nof them,â\\x80\\x9d I answered. â\\x80\\x9cBut if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I\\nhave only half an hour.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMy experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect\\nof making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and\\nsimple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my\\nvalise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing\\nup and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and\\ntaller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is really very good of you to come, Watson,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cIt makes a\\nconsiderable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can\\nthoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed.\\nIf you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers\\nwhich Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read,\\nwith intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past\\nReading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and\\ntossed them up onto the rack.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave you heard anything of the case?â\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been\\nlooking through all the recent papers in order to master the\\nparticulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple\\ncases which are so extremely difficult.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat sounds a little paradoxical.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue.\\nThe more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it\\nis to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a\\nvery serious case against the son of the murdered man.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is a murder, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted\\nuntil I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will\\nexplain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to\\nunderstand it, in a very few words.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBoscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in\\nHerefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John\\nTurner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to\\nthe old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was\\nlet to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had\\nknown each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that\\nwhen they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as\\npossible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his\\ntenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as\\nthey were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen,\\nand Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them\\nhad wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the\\nneighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though\\nboth the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the\\nrace-meetings of the neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servantsâ\\x80\\x94a man\\nand a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the\\nleast. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the\\nfamilies. Now for the facts.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at\\nHatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe\\nPool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream\\nwhich runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his\\nserving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he\\nmust hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three.\\nFrom that appointment he never came back alive.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFrom Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile,\\nand two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old\\nwoman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder,\\na game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose\\nthat Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a\\nfew minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr.\\nJames McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the\\nbest of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and\\nthe son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he\\nheard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the\\ngame-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded\\nround, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl\\nof fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of\\nthe Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers.\\nShe states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood\\nand close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared\\nto be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using\\nvery strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his\\nhand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their\\nviolence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home\\nthat she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and\\nthat she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said\\nthe words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say\\nthat he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help\\nof the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his\\nhat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with\\nfresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out\\nupon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated\\nblows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might\\nvery well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his sonâ\\x80\\x99s gun, which\\nwas found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under\\nthese circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict\\nof â\\x80\\x98wilful murderâ\\x80\\x99 having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he\\nwas on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have\\nreferred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the\\ncase as they came out before the coroner and the police-court.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI could hardly imagine a more damning case,â\\x80\\x9d I remarked. â\\x80\\x9cIf ever\\ncircumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCircumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,â\\x80\\x9d answered Holmes\\nthoughtfully. â\\x80\\x9cIt may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if\\nyou shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in\\nan equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It\\nmust be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave\\nagainst the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the\\nculprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and\\namong them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who\\nbelieve in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may\\nrecollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case\\nin his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case\\nto me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying\\nwestward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their\\nbreakfasts at home.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am afraid,â\\x80\\x9d said I, â\\x80\\x9cthat the facts are so obvious that you will\\nfind little credit to be gained out of this case.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,â\\x80\\x9d he answered,\\nlaughing. â\\x80\\x9cBesides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts\\nwhich may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me\\ntoo well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either\\nconfirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of\\nemploying, or even of understanding. To take the first example to hand,\\nI very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the\\nright-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have\\nnoted even so self-evident a thing as that.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow on earthâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which\\ncharacterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you\\nshave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete\\nas we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively\\nslovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear\\nthat that side is less illuminated than the other. I could not imagine\\na man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being\\nsatisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial example of\\nobservation and inference. Therein lies my _mÃ©tier_, and it is just\\npossible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies\\nbefore us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in\\nthe inquest, and which are worth considering.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat are they?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the\\nreturn to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing\\nhim that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to\\nhear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of\\nhis had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might\\nhave remained in the minds of the coronerâ\\x80\\x99s jury.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was a confession,â\\x80\\x9d I ejaculated.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cComing on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least\\na most suspicious remark.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn the contrary,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, â\\x80\\x9cit is the brightest rift which I can\\nat present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could\\nnot be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances\\nwere very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own\\narrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as\\nhighly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural\\nunder the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to\\na scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as\\neither an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint\\nand firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not\\nunnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his\\nfather, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far\\nforgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even,\\naccording to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise\\nhis hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which\\nare displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy\\nmind rather than of a guilty one.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI shook my head. â\\x80\\x9cMany men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,â\\x80\\x9d\\nI remarked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is the young manâ\\x80\\x99s own account of the matter?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though\\nthere are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find\\nit here, and may read it for yourself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper,\\nand having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which\\nthe unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had\\noccurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read\\nit very carefully. It ran in this way:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and\\ngave evidence as follows: â\\x80\\x98I had been away from home for three days at\\nBristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday,\\nthe 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and\\nI was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John\\nCobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap\\nin the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk\\nrapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he\\nwas going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the\\nBoscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which\\nis upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the\\ngame-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in\\nthinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in\\nfront of me. When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCooee!â\\x80\\x9d which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then\\nhurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to be\\nmuch surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was\\ndoing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost\\nto blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that\\nhis passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards\\nHatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I\\nheard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. I\\nfound my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly\\ninjured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost\\ninstantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made\\nmy way to Mr. Turnerâ\\x80\\x99s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to\\nask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I\\nhave no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man,\\nbeing somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far\\nas I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWitness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion\\nto a rat.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Coroner: What did you understand by that?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWitness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was\\ndelirious.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had\\nthis final quarrel?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWitness: I should prefer not to answer.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWitness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you\\nthat it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to\\nyou that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably\\nin any future proceedings which may arise.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWitness: I must still refuse.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Coroner: I understand that the cry of â\\x80\\x98Cooeeâ\\x80\\x99 was a common signal\\nbetween you and your father?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWitness: It was.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you,\\nand before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWitness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you\\nreturned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWitness: Nothing definite.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Coroner: What do you mean?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWitness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open,\\nthat I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague\\nimpression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the\\nleft of me. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of\\nsome sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked\\nround for it, but it was gone.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Yes, it was gone.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c  â\\x80\\x98You cannot say what it was?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98No, I had a feeling something was there.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98How far from the body?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98A dozen yards or so.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98And how far from the edge of the wood?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98About the same.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of\\nit?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Yes, but with my back towards it.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis concluded the examination of the witness.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see,â\\x80\\x9d said I as I glanced down the column, â\\x80\\x9cthat the coroner in his\\nconcluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls\\nattention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having\\nsignalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details\\nof his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his\\nfatherâ\\x80\\x99s dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against\\nthe son.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHolmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the\\ncushioned seat. â\\x80\\x9cBoth you and the coroner have been at some pains,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid he, â\\x80\\x9cto single out the very strongest points in the young manâ\\x80\\x99s\\nfavour. Donâ\\x80\\x99t you see that you alternately give him credit for having\\ntoo much imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent\\na cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too\\nmuch, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so\\n_outrÃ©_ as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the\\nvanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of\\nview that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither\\nthat hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and\\nnot another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of\\naction. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty\\nminutes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was nearly four oâ\\x80\\x99clock when we at last, after passing through the\\nbeautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found\\nourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean,\\nferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the\\nplatform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings\\nwhich he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no\\ndifficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove\\nto the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have ordered a carriage,â\\x80\\x9d said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until\\nyou had been on the scene of the crime.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was very nice and complimentary of you,â\\x80\\x9d Holmes answered. â\\x80\\x9cIt is\\nentirely a question of barometric pressure.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLestrade looked startled. â\\x80\\x9cI do not quite follow,â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the\\nsky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the\\nsofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do\\nnot think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLestrade laughed indulgently. â\\x80\\x9cYou have, no doubt, already formed your\\nconclusions from the newspapers,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThe case is as plain as a\\npikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still,\\nof course, one canâ\\x80\\x99t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too.\\nShe has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly\\ntold her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not\\nalready done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most\\nlovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes\\nshining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of\\nher natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!â\\x80\\x9d she cried, glancing from one to the other of\\nus, and finally, with a womanâ\\x80\\x99s quick intuition, fastening upon my\\ncompanion, â\\x80\\x9cI am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell\\nyou so. I know that James didnâ\\x80\\x99t do it. I know it, and I want you to\\nstart upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon\\nthat point. We have known each other since we were little children, and\\nI know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to\\nhurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,â\\x80\\x9d said Sherlock Holmes. â\\x80\\x9cYou may\\nrely upon my doing all that I can.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do\\nyou not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he\\nis innocent?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think that it is very probable.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere, now!â\\x80\\x9d she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly\\nat Lestrade. â\\x80\\x9cYou hear! He gives me hopes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. â\\x80\\x9cI am afraid that my colleague has\\nbeen a little quick in forming his conclusions,â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And\\nabout his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he\\nwould not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in\\nit.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn what way?â\\x80\\x9d asked Holmes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many\\ndisagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should\\nbe a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as\\nbrother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little\\nof life yet, andâ\\x80\\x94andâ\\x80\\x94well, he naturally did not wish to do anything\\nlike that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of\\nthem.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd your father?â\\x80\\x9d asked Holmes. â\\x80\\x9cWas he in favour of such a union?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of\\nit.â\\x80\\x9d A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one\\nof his keen, questioning glances at her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you for this information,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cMay I see your father if I\\ncall to-morrow?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am afraid the doctor wonâ\\x80\\x99t allow it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe doctor?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years\\nback, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed,\\nand Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is\\nshattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the\\nold days in Victoria.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHa! In Victoria! That is important.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, at the mines.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made\\nhis money.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, certainly.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go\\nto the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that\\nI know him to be innocent.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will, Miss Turner.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I\\nleave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.â\\x80\\x9d She hurried\\nfrom the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the\\nwheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am ashamed of you, Holmes,â\\x80\\x9d said Lestrade with dignity after a few\\nminutesâ\\x80\\x99 silence. â\\x80\\x9cWhy should you raise up hopes which you are bound to\\ndisappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave you an order to see him in prison?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, but only for you and me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still\\ntime to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAmple.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but\\nI shall only be away a couple of hours.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the\\nstreets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay\\nupon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel.\\nThe puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the\\ndeep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention\\nwander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last flung\\nit across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of\\nthe events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young manâ\\x80\\x99s story\\nwere absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely\\nunforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the\\ntime when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by\\nhis screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and\\ndeadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal\\nsomething to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the\\nweekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest.\\nIn the surgeonâ\\x80\\x99s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of\\nthe left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been\\nshattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon\\nmy own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind.\\nThat was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen\\nquarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go\\nfor very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the\\nblow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmesâ\\x80\\x99 attention to\\nit. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could\\nthat mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow\\ndoes not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an\\nattempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I\\ncudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the\\nincident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true\\nthe murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his\\novercoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and\\nto carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back\\nturned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and\\nimprobabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestradeâ\\x80\\x99s\\nopinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmesâ\\x80\\x99 insight that I\\ncould not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen\\nhis conviction of young McCarthyâ\\x80\\x99s innocence.\\n\\nIt was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for\\nLestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe glass still keeps very high,â\\x80\\x9d he remarked as he sat down. â\\x80\\x9cIt is\\nof importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the\\nground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest\\nfor such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by\\na long journey. I have seen young McCarthy.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd what did you learn from him?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNothing.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCould he throw no light?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNone at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had\\ndone it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is\\nas puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth,\\nthough comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI cannot admire his taste,â\\x80\\x9d I remarked, â\\x80\\x9cif it is indeed a fact that\\nhe was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss\\nTurner.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly,\\ninsanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a\\nlad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at\\na boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of\\na barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office? No one knows a\\nword of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him\\nto be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do,\\nbut what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of\\nthis sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his\\nfather, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss\\nTurner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and\\nhis father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown\\nhim over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife\\nthat he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did\\nnot know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has\\ncome out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers\\nthat he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him\\nover utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband\\nalready in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between\\nthem. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all\\nthat he has suffered.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut if he is innocent, who has done it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points.\\nOne is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the\\npool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was\\naway, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that the\\nmurdered man was heard to cry â\\x80\\x98Cooee!â\\x80\\x99 before he knew that his son had\\nreturned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. And\\nnow let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall\\nleave all minor matters until to-morrow.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright\\nand cloudless. At nine oâ\\x80\\x99clock Lestrade called for us with the\\ncarriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is serious news this morning,â\\x80\\x9d Lestrade observed. â\\x80\\x9cIt is said\\nthat Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAn elderly man, I presume?â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbout sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life\\nabroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business\\nhas had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthyâ\\x80\\x99s,\\nand, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he\\ngave him Hatherley Farm rent free.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIndeed! That is interesting,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about\\nhere speaks of his kindness to him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cReally! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this\\nMcCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been\\nunder such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son\\nto Turnerâ\\x80\\x99s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and\\nthat in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a\\nproposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we\\nknow that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us\\nas much. Do you not deduce something from that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe have got to the deductions and the inferences,â\\x80\\x9d said Lestrade,\\nwinking at me. â\\x80\\x9cI find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without\\nflying away after theories and fancies.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are right,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes demurely; â\\x80\\x9cyou do find it very hard to\\ntackle the facts.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to\\nget hold of,â\\x80\\x9d replied Lestrade with some warmth.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd that isâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all\\ntheories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, laughing.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the\\nleft.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, that is it.â\\x80\\x9d It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building,\\ntwo-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon\\nthe grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however,\\ngave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay\\nheavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmesâ\\x80\\x99\\nrequest, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his\\ndeath, and also a pair of the sonâ\\x80\\x99s, though not the pair which he had\\nthen had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight\\ndifferent points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from\\nwhich we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as\\nthis. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker\\nStreet would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and\\ndarkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his\\neyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was\\nbent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins\\nstood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed\\nto dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so\\nabsolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or\\nremark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a\\nquick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way\\nalong the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the\\nwoods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that\\ndistrict, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and\\namid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes\\nwould hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little\\ndetour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective\\nindifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the\\ninterest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions\\nwas directed towards a definite end.\\n\\nThe Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some\\nfifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley\\nFarm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods\\nwhich lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting\\npinnacles which marked the site of the rich landownerâ\\x80\\x99s dwelling. On\\nthe Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was\\na narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of\\nthe trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the\\nexact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was\\nthe ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by\\nthe fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager\\nface and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the\\ntrampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and\\nthen turned upon my companion.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat did you go into the pool for?â\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or\\nother trace. But how on earthâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward\\ntwist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it\\nvanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I\\nbeen here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over\\nit. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have\\ncovered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But here are\\nthree separate tracks of the same feet.â\\x80\\x9d He drew out a lens and lay\\ndown upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time\\nrather to himself than to us. â\\x80\\x9cThese are young McCarthyâ\\x80\\x99s feet. Twice\\nhe was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply\\nmarked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran\\nwhen he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the fatherâ\\x80\\x99s feet\\nas he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the\\ngun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here?\\nTiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go,\\nthey come againâ\\x80\\x94of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they\\ncome from?â\\x80\\x9d He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the\\ntrack until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the\\nshadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes\\ntraced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon\\nhis face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained\\nthere, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what\\nseemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens\\nnot only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could\\nreach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he\\ncarefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the\\nwood until he came to the highroad, where all traces were lost.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt has been a case of considerable interest,â\\x80\\x9d he remarked, returning\\nto his natural manner. â\\x80\\x9cI fancy that this grey house on the right must\\nbe the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and\\nperhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our\\nluncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into\\nRoss, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up\\nin the wood.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis may interest you, Lestrade,â\\x80\\x9d he remarked, holding it out. â\\x80\\x9cThe\\nmurder was done with it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see no marks.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere are none.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow do you know, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days.\\nThere was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds\\nwith the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the murderer?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears\\nthick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses\\na cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are\\nseveral other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our\\nsearch.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLestrade laughed. â\\x80\\x9cI am afraid that I am still a sceptic,â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTheories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed\\nBritish jury.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Nous verrons_,â\\x80\\x9d answered Holmes calmly. â\\x80\\x9cYou work your own method,\\nand I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall\\nprobably return to London by the evening train.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd leave your case unfinished?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, finished.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut the mystery?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is solved.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho was the criminal, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe gentleman I describe.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut who is he?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSurely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a\\npopulous neighbourhood.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. â\\x80\\x9cI am a practical man,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cand\\nI really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a\\nleft-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the\\nlaughing-stock of Scotland Yard.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll right,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes quietly. â\\x80\\x9cI have given you the chance. Here\\nare your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHaving left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we\\nfound lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought\\nwith a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a\\nperplexing position.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook here, Watson,â\\x80\\x9d he said when the cloth was cleared â\\x80\\x9cjust sit down\\nin this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know quite\\nwhat to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me\\nexpound.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n â\\x80\\x9cPray do so.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, now, in considering this case there are two points about young\\nMcCarthyâ\\x80\\x99s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they\\nimpressed me in his favour and you against him. One was the fact that\\nhis father should, according to his account, cry â\\x80\\x98Cooee!â\\x80\\x99 before seeing\\nhim. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled\\nseveral words, you understand, but that was all that caught the sonâ\\x80\\x99s\\near. Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will\\nbegin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat of this â\\x80\\x98Cooee!â\\x80\\x99 then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as\\nfar as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within\\nearshot. The â\\x80\\x98Cooee!â\\x80\\x99 was meant to attract the attention of whoever it\\nwas that he had the appointment with. But â\\x80\\x98Cooeeâ\\x80\\x99 is a distinctly\\nAustralian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a\\nstrong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him\\nat Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat of the rat, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it\\nout on the table. â\\x80\\x9cThis is a map of the Colony of Victoria,â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wired to Bristol for it last night.â\\x80\\x9d He put his hand over part of\\nthe map. â\\x80\\x9cWhat do you read?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cARAT,â\\x80\\x9d I read.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd now?â\\x80\\x9d He raised his hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBALLARAT.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only\\ncaught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his\\nmurderer. So and so, of Ballarat.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is wonderful!â\\x80\\x9d I exclaimed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down\\nconsiderably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point which,\\ngranting the sonâ\\x80\\x99s statement to be correct, was a certainty. We have\\ncome now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an\\nAustralian from Ballarat with a grey cloak.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be\\napproached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly\\nwander.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite so.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I\\ngained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as\\nto the personality of the criminal.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut how did you gain them?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou know my method. It is founded upon the observation of trifles.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHis height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his\\nstride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, they were peculiar boots.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut his lameness?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his\\nleft. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limpedâ\\x80\\x94he was lame.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut his left-handedness.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by\\nthe surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately\\nbehind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can that be unless it\\nwere by a left-handed man? He had stood behind that tree during the\\ninterview between the father and son. He had even smoked there. I found\\nthe ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables\\nme to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some\\nattention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140\\ndifferent varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found\\nthe ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss\\nwhere he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which\\nare rolled in Rotterdam.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the cigar-holder?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used\\na holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not\\na clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHolmes,â\\x80\\x9d I said, â\\x80\\x9cyou have drawn a net round this man from which he\\ncannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if\\nyou had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in\\nwhich all this points. The culprit isâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. John Turner,â\\x80\\x9d cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our\\nsitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.\\n\\nThe man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow,\\nlimping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude,\\nand yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs\\nshowed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of\\ncharacter. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping\\neyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his\\nappearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the\\ncorners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear\\nto me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic\\ndisease.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPray sit down on the sofa,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes gently. â\\x80\\x9cYou had my note?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see\\nme here to avoid scandal.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd why did you wish to see me?â\\x80\\x9d He looked across at my companion with\\ndespair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. â\\x80\\x9cIt is\\nso. I know all about McCarthy.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe old man sank his face in his hands. â\\x80\\x9cGod help me!â\\x80\\x9d he cried. â\\x80\\x9cBut I\\nwould not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that\\nI would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am glad to hear you say so,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes gravely.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would\\nbreak her heartâ\\x80\\x94it will break her heart when she hears that I am\\narrested.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt may not come to that,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who\\nrequired my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young\\nMcCarthy must be got off, however.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am a dying man,â\\x80\\x9d said old Turner. â\\x80\\x9cI have had diabetes for years. My\\ndoctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would\\nrather die under my own roof than in a gaol.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHolmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a\\nbundle of paper before him. â\\x80\\x9cJust tell us the truth,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cI shall\\njot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it.\\nThen I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save\\nyoung McCarthy. I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is\\nabsolutely needed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s as well,â\\x80\\x9d said the old man; â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s a question whether I shall live\\nto the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare\\nAlice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has\\nbeen a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou didnâ\\x80\\x99t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I\\ntell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he.\\nHis grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my\\nlife. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you first how I came to be in his power.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was in the early â\\x80\\x9960â\\x80\\x99s at the diggings. I was a young chap then,\\nhot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got\\namong bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to\\nthe bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway\\nrobber. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it,\\nsticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the\\nroad to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under,\\nand our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay\\nin wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us,\\nso it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the\\nfirst volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the\\nswag. I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this\\nvery man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I\\nspared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as\\nthough to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became\\nwealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected.\\nThere I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a\\nquiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be\\nin the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to\\nmake up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and\\nthough my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice. Even when\\nshe was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path\\nas nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf and\\ndid my best to make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy\\nlaid his grip upon me.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent\\nStreet with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Here we are, Jack,â\\x80\\x99 says he, touching me on the arm; â\\x80\\x98weâ\\x80\\x99ll be as\\ngood as a family to you. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s two of us, me and my son, and you can\\nhave the keeping of us. If you donâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s a fine, law-abiding country\\nis England, and thereâ\\x80\\x99s always a policeman within hail.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them\\noff, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since.\\nThere was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I\\nwould, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse\\nas Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my\\npast than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever\\nit was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last\\nhe asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHis son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known\\nto be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad\\nshould step into the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not\\nhave his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to\\nthe lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm.\\nMcCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to meet at\\nthe pool midway between our houses to talk it over.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a\\ncigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I\\nlistened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come\\nuppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little\\nregard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the\\nstreets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear\\nshould be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the\\nbond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind\\nand fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my\\nmemory and my girl! Both could be saved if I could but silence that\\nfoul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I\\nhave sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that\\nmy girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more\\nthan I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if\\nhe had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son;\\nbut I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back\\nto fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true\\nstory, gentlemen, of all that occurred.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, it is not for me to judge you,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes as the old man\\nsigned the statement which had been drawn out. â\\x80\\x9cI pray that we may\\nnever be exposed to such a temptation.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will\\nsoon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes. I\\nwill keep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be\\nforced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and\\nyour secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFarewell, then,â\\x80\\x9d said the old man solemnly. â\\x80\\x9cYour own deathbeds, when\\nthey come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you\\nhave given to mine.â\\x80\\x9d Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he\\nstumbled slowly from the room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGod help us!â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes after a long silence. â\\x80\\x9cWhy does fate play\\nsuch tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as\\nthis that I do not think of Baxterâ\\x80\\x99s words, and say, â\\x80\\x98There, but for\\nthe grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nJames McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number\\nof objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the\\ndefending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our\\ninterview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son\\nand daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the\\nblack cloud which rests upon their past.\\n\\n\\n\\nV. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS\\n\\nWhen I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases\\nbetween the years â\\x80\\x9982 and â\\x80\\x9990, I am faced by so many which present\\nstrange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know\\nwhich to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained\\npublicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for\\nthose peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree,\\nand which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some, too,\\nhave baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives,\\nbeginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially\\ncleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture\\nand surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to\\nhim. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in\\nits details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give\\nsome account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in\\nconnection with it which never have been, and probably never will be,\\nentirely cleared up.\\n\\nThe year â\\x80\\x9987 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or\\nless interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under\\nthis one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the\\nParadol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious\\nclub in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts\\nconnected with the loss of the British barque _Sophy Anderson_, of the\\nsingular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and\\nfinally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be\\nremembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead manâ\\x80\\x99s\\nwatch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that\\ntherefore the deceased had gone to bed within that timeâ\\x80\\x94a deduction\\nwhich was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these\\nI may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such\\nsingular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have\\nnow taken up my pen to describe.\\n\\nIt was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had\\nset in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and the\\nrain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of\\ngreat, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for the\\ninstant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those\\ngreat elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his\\ncivilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the\\nstorm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a\\nchild in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the\\nfireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was\\ndeep in one of Clark Russellâ\\x80\\x99s fine sea-stories until the howl of the\\ngale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the\\nrain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My wife was\\non a visit to her motherâ\\x80\\x99s, and for a few days I was a dweller once\\nmore in my old quarters at Baker Street.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy,â\\x80\\x9d said I, glancing up at my companion, â\\x80\\x9cthat was surely the bell.\\nWho could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcept yourself I have none,â\\x80\\x9d he answered. â\\x80\\x9cI do not encourage\\nvisitors.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA client, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on\\nsuch a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to\\nbe some crony of the landladyâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a\\nstep in the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his\\nlong arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant\\nchair upon which a newcomer must sit.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome in!â\\x80\\x9d said he.\\n\\nThe man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside,\\nwell-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy\\nin his bearing. The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and\\nhis long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he\\nhad come. He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I\\ncould see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a\\nman who is weighed down with some great anxiety.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI owe you an apology,â\\x80\\x9d he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his\\neyes. â\\x80\\x9cI trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought some\\ntraces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGive me your coat and umbrella,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes. â\\x80\\x9cThey may rest here on\\nthe hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from the\\nsouth-west, I see.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, from Horsham.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite\\ndistinctive.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have come for advice.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is easily got.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd help.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is not always so easy.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how\\nyou saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe said that you could solve anything.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe said too much.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat you are never beaten.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have been beaten four timesâ\\x80\\x94three times by men, and once by a\\nwoman.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what is that compared with the number of your successes?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is true that I have been generally successful.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you may be so with me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with\\nsome details as to your case.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is no ordinary one.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNone of those which come to me are. I am the last court of appeal.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have\\never listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events\\nthan those which have happened in my own family.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou fill me with interest,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes. â\\x80\\x9cPray give us the essential\\nfacts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to\\nthose details which seem to me to be most important.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards\\nthe blaze.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy name,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cis John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far\\nas I can understand, little to do with this awful business. It is a\\nhereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must\\ngo back to the commencement of the affair.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou must know that my grandfather had two sonsâ\\x80\\x94my uncle Elias and my\\nfather Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he\\nenlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee\\nof the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such\\nsuccess that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome\\ncompetence.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became\\na planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well. At\\nthe time of the war he fought in Jacksonâ\\x80\\x99s army, and afterwards under\\nHood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my\\nuncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four\\nyears. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small\\nestate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune\\nin the States, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the\\nnegroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the\\nfranchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered,\\nvery foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring\\ndisposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if\\never he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three fields\\nround his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very\\noften for weeks on end he would never leave his room. He drank a great\\ndeal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and\\ndid not want any friends, not even his own brother.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe didnâ\\x80\\x99t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time\\nwhen he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be\\nin the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He\\nbegged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in\\nhis way. When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and\\ndraughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the\\nservants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was\\nsixteen I was quite master of the house. I kept all the keys and could\\ngo where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him\\nin his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had a\\nsingle room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably\\nlocked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to\\nenter. With a boyâ\\x80\\x99s curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I\\nwas never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and\\nbundles as would be expected in such a room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne dayâ\\x80\\x94it was in March, 1883â\\x80\\x94a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon\\nthe table in front of the colonelâ\\x80\\x99s plate. It was not a common thing\\nfor him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money,\\nand he had no friends of any sort. â\\x80\\x98From India!â\\x80\\x99 said he as he took it\\nup, â\\x80\\x98Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?â\\x80\\x99 Opening it hurriedly, out\\nthere jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon\\nhis plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my\\nlips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were\\nprotruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope\\nwhich he still held in his trembling hand, â\\x80\\x98K. K. K.!â\\x80\\x99 he shrieked, and\\nthen, â\\x80\\x98My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98What is it, uncle?â\\x80\\x99 I cried.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Death,â\\x80\\x99 said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room,\\nleaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw\\nscrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter\\nK three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried\\npips. What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the\\nbreakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with\\nan old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand,\\nand a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98They may do what they like, but Iâ\\x80\\x99ll checkmate them still,â\\x80\\x99 said he\\nwith an oath. â\\x80\\x98Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day,\\nand send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step\\nup to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there\\nwas a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass\\nbox stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed,\\nwith a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had\\nread in the morning upon the envelope.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I wish you, John,â\\x80\\x99 said my uncle, â\\x80\\x98to witness my will. I leave my\\nestate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my\\nbrother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you\\ncan enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my\\nadvice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to\\ngive you such a two-edged thing, but I canâ\\x80\\x99t say what turn things are\\ngoing to take. Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him.\\nThe singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression\\nupon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind\\nwithout being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off\\nthe vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation\\ngrew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the\\nusual routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle, however.\\nHe drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of\\nsociety. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door\\nlocked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of\\ndrunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the\\ngarden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of\\nno man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by\\nman or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush\\ntumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man\\nwho can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the\\nroots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold\\nday, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse\\nyour patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken\\nsallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to\\nsearch for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay\\nat the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the\\nwater was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his\\nknown eccentricity, brought in a verdict of â\\x80\\x98suicide.â\\x80\\x99 But I, who knew\\nhow he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade\\nmyself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed,\\nhowever, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of\\nsome Â£ 14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne moment,â\\x80\\x9d Holmes interposed, â\\x80\\x9cyour statement is, I foresee, one of\\nthe most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date\\nof the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his\\nsupposed suicide.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later,\\nupon the night of May 2nd.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you. Pray proceed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made\\na careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We\\nfound the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On\\nthe inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K.\\nK. repeated upon it, and â\\x80\\x98Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a registerâ\\x80\\x99\\nwritten beneath. These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers\\nwhich had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was\\nnothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered\\npapers and note-books bearing upon my uncleâ\\x80\\x99s life in America. Some of\\nthem were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and\\nhad borne the repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a date during\\nthe reconstruction of the Southern states, and were mostly concerned\\nwith politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the\\ncarpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, it was the beginning of â\\x80\\x9984 when my father came to live at\\nHorsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January of\\nâ\\x80\\x9985. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a\\nsharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There\\nhe was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried\\norange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. He had always\\nlaughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but\\nhe looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon\\nhimself.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Why, what on earth does this mean, John?â\\x80\\x99 he stammered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy heart had turned to lead. â\\x80\\x98It is K. K. K.,â\\x80\\x99 said I.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe looked inside the envelope. â\\x80\\x98So it is,â\\x80\\x99 he cried. â\\x80\\x98Here are the\\nvery letters. But what is this written above them?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Put the papers on the sundial,â\\x80\\x99 I read, peeping over his shoulder.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98What papers? What sundial?â\\x80\\x99 he asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98The sundial in the garden. There is no other,â\\x80\\x99 said I; â\\x80\\x98but the\\npapers must be those that are destroyed.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Pooh!â\\x80\\x99 said he, gripping hard at his courage. â\\x80\\x98We are in a civilised\\nland here, and we canâ\\x80\\x99t have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the\\nthing come from?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98From Dundee,â\\x80\\x99 I answered, glancing at the postmark.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Some preposterous practical joke,â\\x80\\x99 said he. â\\x80\\x98What have I to do with\\nsundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I should certainly speak to the police,â\\x80\\x99 I said.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Then let me do so?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98No, I forbid you. I wonâ\\x80\\x99t have a fuss made about such nonsense.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I\\nwent about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from\\nhome to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command\\nof one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go,\\nfor it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away\\nfrom home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his\\nabsence I received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at\\nonce. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound\\nin the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull.\\nI hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his\\nconsciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in\\nthe twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit\\nunfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of â\\x80\\x98death\\nfrom accidental causes.â\\x80\\x99 Carefully as I examined every fact connected\\nwith his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the\\nidea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no\\nrobbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And\\nyet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I\\nwas well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I\\ndid not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our\\ntroubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncleâ\\x80\\x99s\\nlife, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in\\nanother.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was in January, â\\x80\\x9985, that my poor father met his end, and two years\\nand eight months have elapsed since then. During that time I have lived\\nhappily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed\\naway from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I\\nhad begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow\\nfell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning\\nto the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is the envelope,â\\x80\\x9d he continued. â\\x80\\x9cThe postmark is Londonâ\\x80\\x94eastern\\ndivision. Within are the very words which were upon my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s last\\nmessage: â\\x80\\x98K. K. K.â\\x80\\x99; and then â\\x80\\x98Put the papers on the sundial.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat have you done?â\\x80\\x9d asked Holmes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNothing.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNothing?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo tell the truthâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94he sank his face into his thin, white handsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cI have\\nfelt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the\\nsnake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some\\nresistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can\\nguard against.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTut! tut!â\\x80\\x9d cried Sherlock Holmes. â\\x80\\x9cYou must act, man, or you are lost.\\nNothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have seen the police.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the\\ninspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical\\njokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as\\nthe jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHolmes shook his clenched hands in the air. â\\x80\\x9cIncredible imbecility!â\\x80\\x9d he\\ncried.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the\\nhouse with me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHas he come with you to-night?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo. His orders were to stay in the house.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAgain Holmes raved in the air.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy did you come to me?â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cand, above all, why did you not\\ncome at once?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast\\nabout my troubles and was advised by him to come to you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted\\nbefore this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which\\nyou have placed before usâ\\x80\\x94no suggestive detail which might help us?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is one thing,â\\x80\\x9d said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat\\npocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he\\nlaid it out upon the table. â\\x80\\x9cI have some remembrance,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cthat\\non the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small,\\nunburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular\\ncolour. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am\\ninclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps,\\nfluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped\\ndestruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us\\nmuch. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. The\\nwriting is undoubtedly my uncleâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHolmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which\\nshowed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It\\nwas headed, â\\x80\\x9cMarch, 1869,â\\x80\\x9d and beneath were the following enigmatical\\nnotices:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain of St.\\nAugustine.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c9th. McCauley cleared.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c10th. John Swain cleared.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c12th. Visited Paramore. All well.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you!â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our\\nvisitor. â\\x80\\x9cAnd now you must on no account lose another instant. We\\ncannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get\\nhome instantly and act.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat shall I do?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put\\nthis piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which\\nyou have described. You must also put in a note to say that all the\\nother papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one\\nwhich remains. You must assert that in such words as will carry\\nconviction with them. Having done this, you must at once put the box\\nout upon the sundial, as directed. Do you understand?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEntirely.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think\\nthat we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to\\nweave, while theirs is already woven. The first consideration is to\\nremove the pressing danger which threatens you. The second is to clear\\nup the mystery and to punish the guilty parties.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thank you,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as you\\nadvise.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the\\nmeanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are\\nthreatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBy train from Waterloo.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you\\nmay be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am armed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI shall see you at Horsham, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to\\nthe box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every particular.â\\x80\\x9d\\nHe shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside the wind still\\nscreamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows. This\\nstrange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad\\nelementsâ\\x80\\x94blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a galeâ\\x80\\x94and now to\\nhave been reabsorbed by them once more.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk\\nforward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit\\nhis pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings\\nas they chased each other up to the ceiling.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think, Watson,â\\x80\\x9d he remarked at last, â\\x80\\x9cthat of all our cases we have\\nhad none more fantastic than this.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSave, perhaps, the Sign of Four.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to me\\nto be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut have you,â\\x80\\x9d I asked, â\\x80\\x9cformed any definite conception as to what\\nthese perils are?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere can be no question as to their nature,â\\x80\\x9d he answered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this\\nunhappy family?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of\\nhis chair, with his finger-tips together. â\\x80\\x9cThe ideal reasoner,â\\x80\\x9d he\\nremarked, â\\x80\\x9cwould, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its\\nbearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up\\nto it but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier\\ncould correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a\\nsingle bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in\\na series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other\\nones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which\\nthe reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study\\nwhich have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of\\ntheir senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is\\nnecessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts\\nwhich have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you\\nwill readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these\\ndays of free education and encyclopÃ¦dias, is a somewhat rare\\naccomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should\\npossess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work,\\nand this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly,\\nyou on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my\\nlimits in a very precise fashion.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d I answered, laughing. â\\x80\\x9cIt was a singular document. Philosophy,\\nastronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany\\nvariable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region\\nwithin fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic,\\nsensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer,\\nswordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I\\nthink, were the main points of my analysis.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHolmes grinned at the last item. â\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cI say now, as I said\\nthen, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all\\nthe furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in\\nthe lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it.\\nNow, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us\\nto-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly hand me\\ndown the letter K of the _American EncyclopÃ¦dia_ which stands upon the\\nshelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see\\nwhat may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a\\nstrong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason\\nfor leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their\\nhabits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the\\nlonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude\\nin England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or\\nsomething, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of\\nsomeone or something which drove him from America. As to what it was he\\nfeared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters\\nwhich were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the\\npostmarks of those letters?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third\\nfrom London.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFrom East London. What do you deduce from that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that the\\nprobabilityâ\\x80\\x94the strong probabilityâ\\x80\\x94is that the writer was on board of a\\nship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of\\nPondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment,\\nin Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest\\nanything?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA greater distance to travel.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut the letter had also a greater distance to come.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen I do not see the point.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or\\nmen are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send their\\nsingular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission.\\nYou see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from\\nDundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have\\narrived almost as soon as their letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven\\nweeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the\\ndifference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the\\nsailing vessel which brought the writer.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is possible.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMore than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of\\nthis new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has\\nalways fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to\\ntravel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we\\ncannot count upon delay.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood God!â\\x80\\x9d I cried. â\\x80\\x9cWhat can it mean, this relentless persecution?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to\\nthe person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite\\nclear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not\\nhave carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coronerâ\\x80\\x99s\\njury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men\\nof resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the\\nholder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be\\nthe initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut of what society?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave you neverâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his\\nvoiceâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9chave you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI never have.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHolmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. â\\x80\\x9cHere it is,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid he presently:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the\\nsound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was\\nformed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the\\nCivil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of\\nthe country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia,\\nand Florida. Its power was used for political purposes, principally for\\nthe terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from\\nthe country of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were\\nusually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic\\nbut generally recognised shapeâ\\x80\\x94a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts,\\nmelon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this the victim\\nmight either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the\\ncountry. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon\\nhim, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was\\nthe organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that\\nthere is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving\\nit with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to\\nthe perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite\\nof the efforts of the United States government and of the better\\nclasses of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869,\\nthe movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been\\nsporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will observe,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, laying down the volume, â\\x80\\x9cthat the\\nsudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance\\nof Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause\\nand effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the\\nmore implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this\\nregister and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South,\\nand that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is\\nrecovered.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen the page we have seenâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, â\\x80\\x98sent the\\npips to A, B, and Câ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94that is, sent the societyâ\\x80\\x99s warning to them. Then\\nthere are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country,\\nand finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C.\\nWell, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place,\\nand I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime\\nis to do what I have told him. There is nothing more to be said or to\\nbe done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget\\nfor half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable\\nways of our fellow men.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued\\nbrightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city.\\nSherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will excuse me for not waiting for you,â\\x80\\x9d said he; â\\x80\\x9cI have, I\\nforesee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young\\nOpenshawâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat steps will you take?â\\x80\\x9d I asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may\\nhave to go down to Horsham, after all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will not go there first?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the maid\\nwill bring up your coffee.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced\\nmy eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my\\nheart.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHolmes,â\\x80\\x9d I cried, â\\x80\\x9cyou are too late.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d said he, laying down his cup, â\\x80\\x9cI feared as much. How was it\\ndone?â\\x80\\x9d He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading â\\x80\\x98Tragedy Near\\nWaterloo Bridge.â\\x80\\x99 Here is the account:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H\\nDivision, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a\\nsplash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy,\\nso that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite\\nimpossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was given, and, by\\nthe aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered. It\\nproved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from\\nan envelope which was found in his pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose\\nresidence is near Horsham. It is conjectured that he may have been\\nhurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that\\nin his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked\\nover the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats.\\nThe body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt\\nthat the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which\\nshould have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to\\nthe condition of the riverside landing-stages.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken\\nthan I had ever seen him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat hurts my pride, Watson,â\\x80\\x9d he said at last. â\\x80\\x9cIt is a petty feeling,\\nno doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter with me\\nnow, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang.\\nThat he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to\\nhis deathâ\\x80\\x94!â\\x80\\x9d He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in\\nuncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a\\nnervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey must be cunning devils,â\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed at last. â\\x80\\x9cHow could they\\nhave decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line\\nto the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a\\nnight, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in\\nthe long run. I am going out now!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo the police?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take\\nthe flies, but not before.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAll day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the\\nevening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come\\nback yet. It was nearly ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock before he entered, looking pale and\\nworn. He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf\\nhe devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of\\nwater.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are hungry,â\\x80\\x9d I remarked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStarving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since\\nbreakfast.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNothing?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot a bite. I had no time to think of it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd how have you succeeded?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have a clue?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long\\nremain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark\\nupon them. It is well thought of!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he\\nsqueezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thrust\\nthem into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote â\\x80\\x9cS. H. for J.\\nO.â\\x80\\x9d Then he sealed it and addressed it to â\\x80\\x9cCaptain James Calhoun,\\nBarque _Lone Star_, Savannah, Georgia.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat will await him when he enters port,â\\x80\\x9d said he, chuckling. â\\x80\\x9cIt may\\ngive him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his\\nfate as Openshaw did before him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd who is this Captain Calhoun?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow did you trace it, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates\\nand names.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have spent the whole day,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cover Lloydâ\\x80\\x99s registers and\\nfiles of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel\\nwhich touched at Pondicherry in January and February in â\\x80\\x9983. There were\\nthirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those\\nmonths. Of these, one, the _Lone Star_, instantly attracted my\\nattention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from\\nLondon, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the\\nUnion.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTexas, I think.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an\\nAmerican origin.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque _Lone\\nStar_ was there in January, â\\x80\\x9985, my suspicion became a certainty. I\\nthen inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of\\nLondon.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe _Lone Star_ had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert\\nDock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide\\nthis morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and\\nlearned that she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly\\nI have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from\\nthe Isle of Wight.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat will you do, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the\\nonly native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and\\nGermans. I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last\\nnight. I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By\\nthe time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will\\nhave carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police\\nof Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a\\ncharge of murder.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the\\nmurderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which\\nwould show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves,\\nwas upon their track. Very long and very severe were the equinoctial\\ngales that year. We waited long for news of the _Lone Star_ of\\nSavannah, but none ever reached us. We did at last hear that somewhere\\nfar out in the Atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen\\nswinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters â\\x80\\x9cL. S.â\\x80\\x9d carved upon\\nit, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the _Lone\\nStar_.\\n\\n\\n\\nVI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP\\n\\nIsa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the\\nTheological College of St. Georgeâ\\x80\\x99s, was much addicted to opium. The\\nhabit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he\\nwas at college; for having read De Quinceyâ\\x80\\x99s description of his dreams\\nand sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt\\nto produce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that\\nthe practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years\\nhe continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and\\npity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow,\\npasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a\\nchair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.\\n\\nOne nightâ\\x80\\x94it was in June, â\\x80\\x9989â\\x80\\x94there came a ring to my bell, about the\\nhour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up\\nin my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made\\na little face of disappointment.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA patient!â\\x80\\x9d said she. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll have to go out.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.\\n\\nWe heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon\\nthe linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some\\ndark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will excuse my calling so late,â\\x80\\x9d she began, and then, suddenly\\nlosing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my\\nwifeâ\\x80\\x99s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. â\\x80\\x9cOh, Iâ\\x80\\x99m in such trouble!â\\x80\\x9d\\nshe cried; â\\x80\\x9cI do so want a little help.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy,â\\x80\\x9d said my wife, pulling up her veil, â\\x80\\x9cit is Kate Whitney. How you\\nstartled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t know what to do, so I came straight to you.â\\x80\\x9d That was always\\nthe way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a\\nlighthouse.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and\\nwater, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you\\nrather that I sent James off to bed?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, no, no! I want the doctorâ\\x80\\x99s advice and help, too. Itâ\\x80\\x99s about Isa.\\nHe has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about him!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s\\ntrouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school\\ncompanion. We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find.\\nDid she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring\\nhim back to her?\\n\\nIt seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he\\nhad, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest\\neast of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one\\nday, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But\\nnow the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay\\nthere, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison\\nor sleeping off the effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of\\nit, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do?\\nHow could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place\\nand pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?\\n\\nThere was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it.\\nMight I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought,\\nwhy should she come at all? I was Isa Whitneyâ\\x80\\x99s medical adviser, and as\\nsuch I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were\\nalone. I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab\\nwithin two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given\\nme. And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair and cheery\\nsitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a\\nstrange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only\\ncould show how strange it was to be.\\n\\nBut there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure.\\nUpper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves\\nwhich line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge.\\nBetween a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of\\nsteps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the\\nden of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down\\nthe steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken\\nfeet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found\\nthe latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with\\nthe brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the\\nforecastle of an emigrant ship.\\n\\nThrough the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in\\nstrange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown\\nback, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark,\\nlack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shadows\\nthere glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as\\nthe burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The\\nmost lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked\\ntogether in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming\\nin gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling\\nout his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his\\nneighbour. At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal,\\nbeside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old\\nman, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his\\nknees, staring into the fire.\\n\\nAs I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for\\nme and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you. I have not come to stay,â\\x80\\x9d said I. â\\x80\\x9cThere is a friend of\\nmine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering\\nthrough the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring\\nout at me.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy God! Itâ\\x80\\x99s Watson,â\\x80\\x9d said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction,\\nwith every nerve in a twitter. â\\x80\\x9cI say, Watson, what oâ\\x80\\x99clock is it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNearly eleven.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf what day?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf Friday, June 19th.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What dâ\\x80\\x99you\\nwant to frighten a chap for?â\\x80\\x9d He sank his face onto his arms and began\\nto sob in a high treble key.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two\\ndays for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo I am. But youâ\\x80\\x99ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few\\nhours, three pipes, four pipesâ\\x80\\x94I forget how many. But Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go home with\\nyou. I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t frighten Kateâ\\x80\\x94poor little Kate. Give me your hand! Have\\nyou a cab?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I have one waiting.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe,\\nWatson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers,\\nholding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug,\\nand looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by\\nthe brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice\\nwhispered, â\\x80\\x9cWalk past me, and then look back at me.â\\x80\\x9d The words fell\\nquite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have come\\nfrom the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever,\\nvery thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down\\nfrom between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude\\nfrom his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all\\nmy self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of\\nastonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him but I.\\nHis form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had\\nregained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my\\nsurprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion\\nto me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round\\nto the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped\\nsenility.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHolmes!â\\x80\\x9d I whispered, â\\x80\\x9cwhat on earth are you doing in this den?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs low as you can,â\\x80\\x9d he answered; â\\x80\\x9cI have excellent ears. If you would\\nhave the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I\\nshould be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have a cab outside.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he\\nappears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you\\nalso to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have\\nthrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with\\nyou in five minutes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmesâ\\x80\\x99 requests, for they\\nwere always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet\\nair of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in\\nthe cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I\\ncould not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in\\none of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his\\nexistence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitneyâ\\x80\\x99s bill,\\nled him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a\\nvery short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I\\nwas walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he\\nshuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing\\nquickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit\\nof laughter.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI suppose, Watson,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cthat you imagine that I have added\\nopium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little\\nweaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was certainly surprised to find you there.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut not more so than I to find you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI came to find a friend.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd I to find an enemy.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAn enemy?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey.\\nBriefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I\\nhave hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as\\nI have done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would\\nnot have been worth an hourâ\\x80\\x99s purchase; for I have used it before now\\nfor my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to\\nhave vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that\\nbuilding, near the corner of Paulâ\\x80\\x99s Wharf, which could tell some\\nstrange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat! You do not mean bodies?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAy, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had Â£ 1000 for every\\npoor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest\\nmurder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St. Clair\\nhas entered it never to leave it more. But our trap should be here.â\\x80\\x9d He\\nput his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrillyâ\\x80\\x94a signal\\nwhich was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed\\nshortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horsesâ\\x80\\x99 hoofs.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, Watson,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the\\ngloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side\\nlanterns. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll come with me, wonâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf I can be of use.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so.\\nMy room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Cedars?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes; that is Mr. St. Clairâ\\x80\\x99s house. I am staying there while I conduct\\nthe inquiry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere is it, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNear Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I am all in the dark.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course you are. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll know all about it presently. Jump up here.\\nAll right, John; we shall not need you. Hereâ\\x80\\x99s half a crown. Look out\\nfor me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the\\nendless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened\\ngradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with\\nthe murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull\\nwilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy,\\nregular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some\\nbelated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the\\nsky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts\\nof the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his\\nbreast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside\\nhim, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax\\nhis powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of\\nhis thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to\\nthe fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself,\\nshrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who\\nhas satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have a grand gift of silence, Watson,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cIt makes you\\nquite invaluable as a companion. â\\x80\\x99Pon my word, it is a great thing for\\nme to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not\\nover-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little\\nwoman to-night when she meets me at the door.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou forget that I know nothing about it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get\\nto Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to\\ngo upon. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I canâ\\x80\\x99t get the end of\\nit into my hand. Now, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll state the case clearly and concisely to you,\\nWatson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cProceed, then.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSome years agoâ\\x80\\x94to be definite, in May, 1884â\\x80\\x94there came to Lee a\\ngentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of\\nmoney. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and\\nlived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the\\nneighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer,\\nby whom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was\\ninterested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the\\nmorning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St.\\nClair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a\\ngood husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with\\nall who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment,\\nas far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to Â£ 88 10_s_., while\\nhe has Â£ 220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank.\\nThere is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been\\nweighing upon his mind.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLast Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than\\nusual, remarking before he started that he had two important\\ncommissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a\\nbox of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram\\nupon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect\\nthat a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting\\nwas waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company.\\nNow, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the office\\nof the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam\\nLane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch,\\nstarted for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the companyâ\\x80\\x99s\\noffice, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking\\nthrough Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed\\nme so far?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is very clear.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair\\nwalked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did\\nnot like the neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was\\nwalking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an\\nejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down\\nat her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor\\nwindow. The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she\\ndescribes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically to\\nher, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to\\nher that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from\\nbehind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that\\nalthough he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he\\nhad on neither collar nor necktie.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cConvinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the\\nstepsâ\\x80\\x94for the house was none other than the opium den in which you\\nfound me to-nightâ\\x80\\x94and running through the front room she attempted to\\nascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the\\nstairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken,\\nwho thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there,\\npushed her out into the street. Filled with the most maddening doubts\\nand fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in\\nFresno Street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their\\nway to their beat. The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and\\nin spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their\\nway to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no\\nsign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one\\nto be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems,\\nmade his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one\\nelse had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined was\\ntheir denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to\\nbelieve that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she\\nsprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid\\nfrom it. Out there fell a cascade of childrenâ\\x80\\x99s bricks. It was the toy\\nwhich he had promised to bring home.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed,\\nmade the inspector realise that the matter was serious. The rooms were\\ncarefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The\\nfront room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small\\nbedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Between\\nthe wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low\\ntide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of\\nwater. The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On\\nexamination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and\\nseveral scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the\\nbedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the\\nclothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his coat. His\\nboots, his socks, his hat, and his watchâ\\x80\\x94all were there. There were no\\nsigns of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other\\ntraces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he must apparently\\nhave gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous\\nbloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save\\nhimself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment\\nof the tragedy.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in\\nthe matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents,\\nbut as, by Mrs. St. Clairâ\\x80\\x99s story, he was known to have been at the\\nfoot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s appearance\\nat the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the\\ncrime. His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that\\nhe had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and\\nthat he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing\\ngentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s clothes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives\\nupon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last\\nhuman being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name is Hugh\\nBoone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who\\ngoes much to the City. He is a professional beggar, though in order to\\navoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax\\nvestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the\\nleft-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in\\nthe wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,\\ncross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a\\npiteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy\\nleather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the\\nfellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional\\nacquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has\\nreaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that\\nno one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a\\npale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has\\nturned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair\\nof very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the\\ncolour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of\\nmendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply\\nto any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by.\\nThis is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium\\nden, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are\\nin quest.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut a cripple!â\\x80\\x9d said I. â\\x80\\x9cWhat could he have done single-handed against\\na man in the prime of life?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other\\nrespects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your\\nmedical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is\\noften compensated for by exceptional strength in the others.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPray continue your narrative.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window,\\nand she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could\\nbe of no help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who\\nhad charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the\\npremises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the\\nmatter. One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as\\nhe was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated\\nwith his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he\\nwas seized and searched, without anything being found which could\\nincriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his\\nright shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been\\ncut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there,\\nadding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the\\nstains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same\\nsource. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair\\nand swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a\\nmystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clairâ\\x80\\x99s assertion that\\nshe had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she\\nmust have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly\\nprotesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon\\nthe premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh\\nclue.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had\\nfeared to find. It was Neville St. Clairâ\\x80\\x99s coat, and not Neville St.\\nClair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think\\nthey found in the pockets?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI cannot imagine.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies\\nand half-penniesâ\\x80\\x94421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder\\nthat it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a\\ndifferent matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the\\nhouse. It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when\\nthe stripped body had been sucked away into the river.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room.\\nWould the body be dressed in a coat alone?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that\\nthis man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there\\nis no human eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then?\\nIt would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the\\ntell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of\\nthrowing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not\\nsink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when\\nthe wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard\\nfrom his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street.\\nThere is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret hoard,\\nwhere he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all\\nthe coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure\\nof the coatâ\\x80\\x99s sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same\\nwith the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and\\nonly just had time to close the window when the police appeared.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt certainly sounds feasible.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better.\\nBoone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but\\nit could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against\\nhim. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life\\nappeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter\\nstands at present, and the questions which have to be solvedâ\\x80\\x94what\\nNeville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when\\nthere, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his\\ndisappearanceâ\\x80\\x94are all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I\\ncannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first\\nglance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWhile Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of\\nevents, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town\\nuntil the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled\\nalong with a country hedge upon either side of us. Just as he finished,\\nhowever, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights\\nstill glimmered in the windows.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe are on the outskirts of Lee,â\\x80\\x9d said my companion. â\\x80\\x9cWe have touched\\non three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex,\\npassing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light\\namong the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman\\nwhose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink\\nof our horseâ\\x80\\x99s feet.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?â\\x80\\x9d I asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs. St.\\nClair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest\\nassured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and\\ncolleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her\\nhusband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own\\ngrounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horseâ\\x80\\x99s head, and springing\\ndown, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to\\nthe house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde\\nwoman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de\\nsoie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She\\nstood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand\\nupon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly\\nbent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a\\nstanding question.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell?â\\x80\\x9d she cried, â\\x80\\x9cwell?â\\x80\\x9d And then, seeing that there were two of us,\\nshe gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my\\ncompanion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo good news?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNone.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo bad?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a\\nlong day.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in\\nseveral of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to\\nbring him out and associate him with this investigation.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am delighted to see you,â\\x80\\x9d said she, pressing my hand warmly. â\\x80\\x9cYou\\nwill, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our\\narrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly\\nupon us.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear madam,â\\x80\\x9d said I, â\\x80\\x9cI am an old campaigner, and if I were not I\\ncan very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of any\\nassistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed\\nhappy.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,â\\x80\\x9d said the lady as we entered a well-lit\\ndining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to\\nwhich I beg that you will give a plain answer.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly, madam.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to\\nfainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cUpon what point?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. â\\x80\\x9cFrankly,\\nnow!â\\x80\\x9d she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at\\nhim as he leaned back in a basket-chair.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFrankly, then, madam, I do not.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou think that he is dead?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMurdered?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t say that. Perhaps.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd on what day did he meet his death?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn Monday.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is\\nthat I have received a letter from him to-day.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat!â\\x80\\x9d he roared.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, to-day.â\\x80\\x9d She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in\\nthe air.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMay I see it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the\\ntable he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I had left my\\nchair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a very\\ncoarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the\\ndate of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was\\nconsiderably after midnight.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCoarse writing,â\\x80\\x9d murmured Holmes. â\\x80\\x9cSurely this is not your husbandâ\\x80\\x99s\\nwriting, madam.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, but the enclosure is.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and\\ninquire as to the address.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow can you tell that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself.\\nThe rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has\\nbeen used. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none\\nwould be of a deep black shade. This man has written the name, and\\nthere has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only\\nmean that he was not familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but\\nthere is nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter.\\nHa! there has been an enclosure here!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you are sure that this is your husbandâ\\x80\\x99s hand?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne of his hands.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHis hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing,\\nand yet I know it well.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a huge\\nerror which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in\\npatience.â\\x80\\x94NEVILLE.â\\x80\\x99 Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book,\\noctavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man\\nwith a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very\\nmuch in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have\\nno doubt that it is your husbandâ\\x80\\x99s hand, madam?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNone. Neville wrote those words.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the\\nclouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is\\nover.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cUnless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The\\nring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no; it is, it is his very own writing!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only\\nposted to-day.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is possible.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf so, much may have happened between.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well\\nwith him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if\\nevil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself\\nin the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly\\nwith the utmost certainty that something had happened. Do you think\\nthat I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his\\ndeath?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be\\nmore valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And in\\nthis letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to\\ncorroborate your view. But if your husband is alive and able to write\\nletters, why should he remain away from you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery much so.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWas the window open?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen he might have called to you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe might.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA call for help, you thought?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. He waved his hands.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the\\nunexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is possible.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you thought he was pulled back?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe disappeared so suddenly.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the room?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the\\nLascar was at the foot of the stairs.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary\\nclothes on?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHad he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHad he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which\\nI wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and\\nthen retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our\\ndisposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after\\nmy night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he\\nhad an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for\\na week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking\\nat it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or\\nconvinced himself that his data were insufficient. It was soon evident\\nto me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off\\nhis coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then\\nwandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions\\nfrom the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of\\nEastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an\\nounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. In\\nthe dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe\\nbetween his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the\\nceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with\\nthe light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I\\ndropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me\\nto wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The\\npipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the\\nroom was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap\\nof shag which I had seen upon the previous night.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAwake, Watson?â\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGame for a morning drive?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy\\nsleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.â\\x80\\x9d He chuckled to himself as\\nhe spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the\\nsombre thinker of the previous night.\\n\\nAs I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was\\nstirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished\\nwhen Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the\\nhorse.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI want to test a little theory of mine,â\\x80\\x9d said he, pulling on his\\nboots. â\\x80\\x9cI think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of\\none of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from\\nhere to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd where is it?â\\x80\\x9d I asked, smiling.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn the bathroom,â\\x80\\x9d he answered. â\\x80\\x9cOh, yes, I am not joking,â\\x80\\x9d he\\ncontinued, seeing my look of incredulity. â\\x80\\x9cI have just been there, and\\nI have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on,\\nmy boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the\\nbright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the\\nhalf-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away\\nwe dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring,\\nbearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on\\neither side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt has been in some points a singular case,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, flicking the\\nhorse on into a gallop. â\\x80\\x9cI confess that I have been as blind as a mole,\\nbut it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIn town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from\\ntheir windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side.\\nPassing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and\\ndashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found\\nourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force,\\nand the two constables at the door saluted him. One of them held the\\nhorseâ\\x80\\x99s head while the other led us in.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho is on duty?â\\x80\\x9d asked Holmes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cInspector Bradstreet, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, Bradstreet, how are you?â\\x80\\x9d A tall, stout official had come down the\\nstone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. â\\x80\\x9cI wish to\\nhave a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table,\\nand a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his\\ndesk.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI called about that beggarman, Booneâ\\x80\\x94the one who was charged with\\nbeing concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo I heard. You have him here?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn the cells.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs he quiet?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDirty?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is\\nas black as a tinkerâ\\x80\\x99s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he\\nwill have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would\\nagree with me that he needed it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should like to see him very much.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWould you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your\\nbag.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I think that Iâ\\x80\\x99ll take it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery good. Come this way, if you please.â\\x80\\x9d He led us down a passage,\\nopened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a\\nwhitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe third on the right is his,â\\x80\\x9d said the inspector. â\\x80\\x9cHere it is!â\\x80\\x9d He\\nquietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced\\nthrough.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe is asleep,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cYou can see him very well.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face\\ntowards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was\\na middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a\\ncoloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He\\nwas, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which\\ncovered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad\\nwheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its\\ncontraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three\\nteeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red\\nhair grew low over his eyes and forehead.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s a beauty, isnâ\\x80\\x99t he?â\\x80\\x9d said the inspector.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe certainly needs a wash,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Holmes. â\\x80\\x9cI had an idea that he\\nmight, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.â\\x80\\x9d He opened\\nthe Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very\\nlarge bath-sponge.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe! he! You are a funny one,â\\x80\\x9d chuckled the inspector.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very\\nquietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know why not,â\\x80\\x9d said the inspector. â\\x80\\x9cHe doesnâ\\x80\\x99t look a\\ncredit to the Bow Street cells, does he?â\\x80\\x9d He slipped his key into the\\nlock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half\\nturned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes\\nstooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it\\ntwice vigorously across and down the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet me introduce you,â\\x80\\x9d he shouted, â\\x80\\x9cto Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee,\\nin the county of Kent.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNever in my life have I seen such a sight. The manâ\\x80\\x99s face peeled off\\nunder the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown\\ntint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and\\nthe twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A\\ntwitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his\\nbed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and\\nsmooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy\\nbewilderment. Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a\\nscream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGreat heavens!â\\x80\\x9d cried the inspector, â\\x80\\x9cit is, indeed, the missing man.\\nI know him from the photograph.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself\\nto his destiny. â\\x80\\x9cBe it so,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cAnd pray what am I charged with?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWith making away with Mr. Neville St.â\\x80\\x94 Oh, come, you canâ\\x80\\x99t be charged\\nwith that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\ninspector with a grin. â\\x80\\x9cWell, I have been twenty-seven years in the\\nforce, but this really takes the cake.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has\\nbeen committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo crime, but a very great error has been committed,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou would have done better to have trusted your wife.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was not the wife; it was the children,â\\x80\\x9d groaned the prisoner. â\\x80\\x9cGod\\nhelp me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an\\nexposure! What can I do?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly\\non the shoulder.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,â\\x80\\x9d said he,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cof course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you\\nconvince the police authorities that there is no possible case against\\nyou, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should\\nfind their way into the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure,\\nmake notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the\\nproper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGod bless you!â\\x80\\x9d cried the prisoner passionately. â\\x80\\x9cI would have endured\\nimprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable\\nsecret as a family blot to my children.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a\\nschoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education.\\nI travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a\\nreporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor wished to\\nhave a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I\\nvolunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all my\\nadventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I\\ncould get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an actor I\\nhad, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been\\nfamous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my\\nattainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as\\npossible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by\\nthe aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head\\nof hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business\\npart of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar.\\nFor seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the\\nevening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26_s_.\\n4_d_.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some\\ntime later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me\\nfor Â£ 25. I was at my witâ\\x80\\x99s end where to get the money, but a sudden\\nidea came to me. I begged a fortnightâ\\x80\\x99s grace from the creditor, asked\\nfor a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the\\nCity under my disguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the\\ndebt.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work\\nat Â£ 2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by\\nsmearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and\\nsitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but\\nthe dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day\\nin the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly\\nface and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew my secret.\\nHe was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam\\nLane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the\\nevenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This\\nfellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew\\nthat my secret was safe in his possession.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money.\\nI do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn Â£ 700\\na yearâ\\x80\\x94which is less than my average takingsâ\\x80\\x94but I had exceptional\\nadvantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of\\nrepartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised\\ncharacter in the City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver,\\npoured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take\\nÂ£ 2.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country,\\nand eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real\\noccupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the City. She\\nlittle knew what.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLast Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room\\nabove the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my\\nhorror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with\\nher eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms\\nto cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated\\nhim to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice\\ndownstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off\\nmy clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and\\nwig. Even a wifeâ\\x80\\x99s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But\\nthen it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and\\nthat the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by\\nmy violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the\\nbedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the\\ncoppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in\\nwhich I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it\\ndisappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but\\nat that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few\\nminutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of\\nbeing identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his\\nmurderer.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was\\ndetermined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my\\npreference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly\\nanxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a\\nmoment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried\\nscrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat note only reached her yesterday,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood God! What a week she must have spent!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe police have watched this Lascar,â\\x80\\x9d said Inspector Bradstreet, â\\x80\\x9cand\\nI can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter\\nunobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who\\nforgot all about it for some days.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat was it,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, nodding approvingly; â\\x80\\x9cI have no doubt of\\nit. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMany times; but what was a fine to me?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt must stop here, however,â\\x80\\x9d said Bradstreet. â\\x80\\x9cIf the police are to\\nhush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be\\ntaken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure,\\nMr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared\\nthe matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI reached this one,â\\x80\\x9d said my friend, â\\x80\\x9cby sitting upon five pillows and\\nconsuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker\\nStreet we shall just be in time for breakfast.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\nVII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE\\n\\nI had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning\\nafter Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of\\nthe season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a\\npipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled\\nmorning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch\\nwas a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and\\ndisreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in\\nseveral places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair\\nsuggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the\\npurpose of examination.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are engaged,â\\x80\\x9d said I; â\\x80\\x9cperhaps I interrupt you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my\\nresults. The matter is a perfectly trivial oneâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94he jerked his thumb in\\nthe direction of the old hatâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cbut there are points in connection with\\nit which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his\\ncrackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were\\nthick with the ice crystals. â\\x80\\x9cI suppose,â\\x80\\x9d I remarked, â\\x80\\x9cthat, homely as\\nit looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to itâ\\x80\\x94that it is\\nthe clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the\\npunishment of some crime.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no. No crime,â\\x80\\x9d said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. â\\x80\\x9cOnly one of those\\nwhimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million\\nhuman beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square\\nmiles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity,\\nevery possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and\\nmany a little problem will be presented which may be striking and\\nbizarre without being criminal. We have already had experience of\\nsuch.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo much so,â\\x80\\x9d I remarked, â\\x80\\x9cthat of the last six cases which I have\\nadded to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrecisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers,\\nto the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of\\nthe man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small\\nmatter will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson,\\nthe commissionaire?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is to him that this trophy belongs.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is his hat.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look\\nupon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem.\\nAnd, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning,\\nin company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting\\nat this moment in front of Petersonâ\\x80\\x99s fire. The facts are these: about\\nfour oâ\\x80\\x99clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a\\nvery honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was\\nmaking his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he\\nsaw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and\\ncarrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the\\ncorner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a\\nlittle knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the manâ\\x80\\x99s hat, on\\nwhich he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his\\nhead, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward\\nto protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at\\nhaving broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in\\nuniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and\\nvanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of\\nTottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of\\nPeterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and\\nalso of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a\\nmost unimpeachable Christmas goose.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhich surely he restored to their owner?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that â\\x80\\x98For Mrs.\\nHenry Bakerâ\\x80\\x99 was printed upon a small card which was tied to the birdâ\\x80\\x99s\\nleft leg, and it is also true that the initials â\\x80\\x98H. B.â\\x80\\x99 are legible\\nupon the lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers,\\nand some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy\\nto restore lost property to any one of them.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat, then, did Peterson do?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning,\\nknowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The\\ngoose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in\\nspite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten\\nwithout unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to\\nfulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the\\nhat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid he not advertise?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen, what clue could you have as to his identity?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOnly as much as we can deduce.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFrom his hat?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrecisely.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as\\nto the individuality of the man who has worn this article?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather\\nruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape,\\nhard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but\\nwas a good deal discoloured. There was no makerâ\\x80\\x99s name; but, as Holmes\\nhad remarked, the initials â\\x80\\x9cH. B.â\\x80\\x9d were scrawled upon one side. It was\\npierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For\\nthe rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several\\nplaces, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the\\ndiscoloured patches by smearing them with ink.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI can see nothing,â\\x80\\x9d said I, handing it back to my friend.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to\\nreason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your\\ninferences.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion\\nwhich was characteristic of him. â\\x80\\x9cIt is perhaps less suggestive than it\\nmight have been,â\\x80\\x9d he remarked, â\\x80\\x9cand yet there are a few inferences\\nwhich are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a\\nstrong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual is\\nof course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly\\nwell-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon\\nevil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing\\nto a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his\\nfortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at\\nwork upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife\\nhas ceased to love him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear Holmes!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,â\\x80\\x9d he continued,\\ndisregarding my remonstrance. â\\x80\\x9cHe is a man who leads a sedentary life,\\ngoes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has\\ngrizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which\\nhe anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are\\nto be deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely\\nimprobable that he has gas laid on in his house.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are certainly joking, Holmes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these\\nresults, you are unable to see how they are attained?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am\\nunable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was\\nintellectual?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFor answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the\\nforehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. â\\x80\\x9cIt is a question of\\ncubic capacity,â\\x80\\x9d said he; â\\x80\\x9ca man with so large a brain must have\\nsomething in it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe decline of his fortunes, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came\\nin then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of\\nribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy\\nso expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he\\nhas assuredly gone down in the world.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and\\nthe moral retrogression?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSherlock Holmes laughed. â\\x80\\x9cHere is the foresight,â\\x80\\x9d said he putting his\\nfinger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. â\\x80\\x9cThey are\\nnever sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a\\ncertain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this\\nprecaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the\\nelastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has\\nless foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a\\nweakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some\\nof these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign\\nthat he has not entirely lost his self-respect.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour reasoning is certainly plausible.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled,\\nthat it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to\\nbe gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining.\\nThe lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the\\nscissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a\\ndistinct odour of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the\\ngritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house,\\nshowing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the\\nmarks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer\\nperspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of\\ntraining.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut his wifeâ\\x80\\x94you said that she had ceased to love him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear\\nWatson, with a weekâ\\x80\\x99s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your\\nwife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also\\nhave been unfortunate enough to lose your wifeâ\\x80\\x99s affection.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut he might be a bachelor.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife.\\nRemember the card upon the birdâ\\x80\\x99s leg.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that\\nthe gas is not laid on in his house?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no\\nless than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the\\nindividual must be brought into frequent contact with burning\\ntallowâ\\x80\\x94walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a\\nguttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from\\na gas-jet. Are you satisfied?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, it is very ingenious,â\\x80\\x9d said I, laughing; â\\x80\\x9cbut since, as you said\\njust now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the\\nloss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open,\\nand Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with\\nflushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!â\\x80\\x9d he gasped.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through\\nthe kitchen window?â\\x80\\x9d Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get\\na fairer view of the manâ\\x80\\x99s excited face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSee here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!â\\x80\\x9d He held out his\\nhand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly\\nscintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of\\nsuch purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the\\ndark hollow of his hand.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. â\\x80\\x9cBy Jove, Peterson!â\\x80\\x9d said he,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthis is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were\\nputty.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s more than a precious stone. It is _the_ precious stone.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot the Countess of Morcarâ\\x80\\x99s blue carbuncle!â\\x80\\x9d I ejaculated.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrecisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have\\nread the advertisement about it in _The Times_ every day lately. It is\\nabsolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the\\nreward offered of Â£ 1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of\\nthe market price.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!â\\x80\\x9d The commissionaire plumped\\ndown into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are\\nsentimental considerations in the background which would induce the\\nCountess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the\\ngem.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan,â\\x80\\x9d I\\nremarked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrecisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a\\nplumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the ladyâ\\x80\\x99s\\njewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case has\\nbeen referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the matter here, I\\nbelieve.â\\x80\\x9d He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates,\\nuntil at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the\\nfollowing paragraph:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was\\nbrought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted\\nfrom the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as\\nthe blue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his\\nevidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room\\nof the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he\\nmight solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had\\nremained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called\\naway. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the\\nbureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in\\nwhich, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep\\nher jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly\\ngave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone\\ncould not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine\\nCusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryderâ\\x80\\x99s cry of\\ndismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room,\\nwhere she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector\\nBradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who\\nstruggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest\\nterms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given\\nagainst the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the\\noffence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of\\nintense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion\\nand was carried out of court.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHum! So much for the police-court,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing\\naside the paper. â\\x80\\x9cThe question for us now to solve is the sequence of\\nevents leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a\\ngoose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our little\\ndeductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less\\ninnocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and\\nthe goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and\\nall the other characteristics with which I have bored you. So now we\\nmust set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and\\nascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To do\\nthis, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly\\nin an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fail, I shall\\nhave recourse to other methods.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat will you say?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGive me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: â\\x80\\x98Found at the\\ncorner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker\\ncan have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker\\nStreet.â\\x80\\x99 That is clear and concise.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery. But will he see it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man,\\nthe loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in\\nbreaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of\\nnothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the\\nimpulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then, again, the\\nintroduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who\\nknows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are, Peterson, run\\ndown to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening\\npapers.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn which, sir?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, in the _Globe_, _Star_, _Pall Mall_, _St. Jamesâ\\x80\\x99s Gazette_,\\n_Evening News_, _Standard_, _Echo_, and any others that occur to you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery well, sir. And this stone?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, just\\nbuy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must\\nhave one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your\\nfamily is now devouring.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWhen the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it\\nagainst the light. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a bonny thing,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cJust see how it\\nglints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime.\\nEvery good stone is. They are the devilâ\\x80\\x99s pet baits. In the larger and\\nolder jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not\\nyet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in\\nsouthern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the\\ncarbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite\\nof its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two\\nmurders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought\\nabout for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal.\\nWho would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows\\nand the prison? Iâ\\x80\\x99ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to\\nthe Countess to say that we have it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you think that this man Horner is innocent?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI cannot tell.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had\\nanything to do with the matter?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely\\ninnocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was\\nof considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That,\\nhowever, I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer\\nto our advertisement.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you can do nothing until then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNothing.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come\\nback in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like\\nto see the solution of so tangled a business.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe.\\nBy the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs.\\nHudson to examine its crop.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six\\nwhen I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached the\\nhouse I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was\\nbuttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which\\nwas thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived the door was opened,\\nand we were shown up together to Holmesâ\\x80\\x99 room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Henry Baker, I believe,â\\x80\\x9d said he, rising from his armchair and\\ngreeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so\\nreadily assume. â\\x80\\x9cPray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a\\ncold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for\\nsummer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right\\ntime. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad,\\nintelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A\\ntouch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended\\nhand, recalled Holmesâ\\x80\\x99 surmise as to his habits. His rusty black\\nfrock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up,\\nand his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff\\nor shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with\\ncare, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and\\nletters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe have retained these things for some days,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, â\\x80\\x9cbecause we\\nexpected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at\\na loss to know now why you did not advertise.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOur visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. â\\x80\\x9cShillings have not been so\\nplentiful with me as they once were,â\\x80\\x9d he remarked. â\\x80\\x9cI had no doubt that\\nthe gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the\\nbird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at\\nrecovering them.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat\\nit.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo eat it!â\\x80\\x9d Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I\\npresume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the\\nsame weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally\\nwell?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, certainly, certainly,â\\x80\\x9d answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your\\nown bird, so if you wishâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe man burst into a hearty laugh. â\\x80\\x9cThey might be useful to me as\\nrelics of my adventure,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cbut beyond that I can hardly see\\nwhat use the _disjecta membra_ of my late acquaintance are going to be\\nto me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my\\nattentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his\\nshoulders.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is your hat, then, and there your bird,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cBy the way,\\nwould it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am\\nsomewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown\\ngoose.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained\\nproperty under his arm. â\\x80\\x9cThere are a few of us who frequent the Alpha\\nInn, near the Museumâ\\x80\\x94we are to be found in the Museum itself during the\\nday, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name,\\ninstituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence\\nevery week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were\\nduly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you,\\nsir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.â\\x80\\x9d\\nWith a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and\\nstrode off upon his way.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo much for Mr. Henry Baker,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes when he had closed the door\\nbehind him. â\\x80\\x9cIt is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about\\nthe matter. Are you hungry, Watson?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot particularly.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up\\nthis clue while it is still hot.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBy all means.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats\\nabout our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a\\ncloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke\\nlike so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as\\nwe swung through the doctorsâ\\x80\\x99 quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street,\\nand so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter of an\\nhour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small\\npublic-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into\\nHolborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two\\nglasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nhe.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy geese!â\\x80\\x9d The man seemed surprised.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was\\na member of your goose club.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh! yes, I see. But you see, sir, themâ\\x80\\x99s not _our_ geese.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIndeed! Whose, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIndeed? I know some of them. Which was it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBreckinridge is his name.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh! I donâ\\x80\\x99t know him. Well, hereâ\\x80\\x99s your good health landlord, and\\nprosperity to your house. Good-night.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow for Mr. Breckinridge,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, buttoning up his coat as we\\ncame out into the frosty air. â\\x80\\x9cRemember, Watson that though we have so\\nhomely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the\\nother a man who will certainly get seven yearsâ\\x80\\x99 penal servitude unless\\nwe can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but\\nconfirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation\\nwhich has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has\\nplaced in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to\\nthe south, then, and quick march!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag\\nof slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the\\nname of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man,\\nwith a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up\\nthe shutters.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood-evening. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a cold night,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes.\\n\\nThe salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSold out of geese, I see,â\\x80\\x9d continued Holmes, pointing at the bare\\nslabs of marble.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet you have five hundred to-morrow morning.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s no good.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, but I was recommended to you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho by?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe landlord of the Alpha.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTo my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the\\nsalesman.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, then, mister,â\\x80\\x9d said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat are you driving at? Letâ\\x80\\x99s have it straight, now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese\\nwhich you supplied to the Alpha.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell then, I shanâ\\x80\\x99t tell you. So now!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, it is a matter of no importance; but I donâ\\x80\\x99t know why you should\\nbe so warm over such a trifle.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWarm! Youâ\\x80\\x99d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I\\npay good money for a good article there should be an end of the\\nbusiness; but itâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x98Where are the geese?â\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98Who did you sell the\\ngeese to?â\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98What will you take for the geese?â\\x80\\x99 One would think they\\nwere the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over\\nthem.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I have no connection with any other people who have been making\\ninquiries,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes carelessly. â\\x80\\x9cIf you wonâ\\x80\\x99t tell us the bet is\\noff, that is all. But Iâ\\x80\\x99m always ready to back my opinion on a matter\\nof fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country\\nbred.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, then, youâ\\x80\\x99ve lost your fiver, for itâ\\x80\\x99s town bred,â\\x80\\x9d snapped the\\nsalesman.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s nothing of the kind.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI say it is.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t believe it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDâ\\x80\\x99you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them\\never since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the\\nAlpha were town bred.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll never persuade me to believe that.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWill you bet, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But Iâ\\x80\\x99ll\\nhave a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe salesman chuckled grimly. â\\x80\\x9cBring me the books, Bill,â\\x80\\x9d said he.\\n\\nThe small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great\\ngreasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow then, Mr. Cocksure,â\\x80\\x9d said the salesman, â\\x80\\x9cI thought that I was out\\nof geese, but before I finish youâ\\x80\\x99ll find that there is still one left\\nin my shop. You see this little book?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s the list of the folk from whom I buy. Dâ\\x80\\x99you see? Well, then,\\nhere on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their\\nnames are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! You\\nsee this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town\\nsuppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Roadâ\\x80\\x94249,â\\x80\\x9d read Holmes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHolmes turned to the page indicated. â\\x80\\x9cHere you are, â\\x80\\x98Mrs. Oakshott,\\n117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, then, whatâ\\x80\\x99s the last entry?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7_s_. 6_d_.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite so. There you are. And underneath?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12_s_.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat have you to say now?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his\\npocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a\\nman whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped\\nunder a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which\\nwas peculiar to him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the â\\x80\\x98Pink â\\x80\\x99unâ\\x80\\x99\\nprotruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nhe. â\\x80\\x9cI daresay that if I had put Â£ 100 down in front of him, that man\\nwould not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him\\nby the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I\\nfancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains\\nto be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott\\nto-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear\\nfrom what that surly fellow said that there are others besides\\nourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I shouldâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHis remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out\\nfrom the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little\\nrat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light\\nwhich was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the\\nsalesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists\\nfiercely at the cringing figure.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve had enough of you and your geese,â\\x80\\x9d he shouted. â\\x80\\x9cI wish you were\\nall at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your\\nsilly talk Iâ\\x80\\x99ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese\\noff you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo; but one of them was mine all the same,â\\x80\\x9d whined the little man.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe told me to ask you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had enough\\nof it. Get out of this!â\\x80\\x9d He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer\\nflitted away into the darkness.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHa! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,â\\x80\\x9d whispered Holmes. â\\x80\\x9cCome\\nwith me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.â\\x80\\x9d Striding\\nthrough the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring\\nstalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him\\nupon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light\\nthat every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho are you, then? What do you want?â\\x80\\x9d he asked in a quavering voice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will excuse me,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes blandly, â\\x80\\x9cbut I could not help\\noverhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I\\nthink that I could be of assistance to you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other\\npeople donâ\\x80\\x99t know.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you can know nothing of this?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to trace some\\ngeese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman\\nnamed Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and\\nby him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,â\\x80\\x9d cried the\\nlittle fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. â\\x80\\x9cI can\\nhardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. â\\x80\\x9cIn that case\\nwe had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept\\nmarket-place,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cBut pray tell me, before we go farther, who it\\nis that I have the pleasure of assisting.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe man hesitated for an instant. â\\x80\\x9cMy name is John Robinson,â\\x80\\x9d he\\nanswered with a sidelong glance.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no; the real name,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes sweetly. â\\x80\\x9cIt is always awkward\\ndoing business with an alias.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. â\\x80\\x9cWell then,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nhe, â\\x80\\x9cmy real name is James Ryder.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrecisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into\\nthe cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you\\nwould wish to know.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with\\nhalf-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he\\nis on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into\\nthe cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker\\nStreet. Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin\\nbreathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of\\nhis hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere we are!â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. â\\x80\\x9cThe\\nfire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr. Ryder.\\nPray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before we\\nsettle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what\\nbecame of those geese?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOr rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which\\nyou were interestedâ\\x80\\x94white, with a black bar across the tail.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRyder quivered with emotion. â\\x80\\x9cOh, sir,â\\x80\\x9d he cried, â\\x80\\x9ccan you tell me\\nwhere it went to?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt came here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I donâ\\x80\\x99t wonder that you\\nshould take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was deadâ\\x80\\x94the\\nbonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here\\nin my museum.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOur visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his\\nright hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue\\ncarbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant,\\nmany-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain\\nwhether to claim or to disown it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe gameâ\\x80\\x99s up, Ryder,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes quietly. â\\x80\\x9cHold up, man, or youâ\\x80\\x99ll\\nbe into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. Heâ\\x80\\x99s not\\ngot blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of\\nbrandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to\\nbe sure!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFor a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought\\na tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened\\neyes at his accuser.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could\\npossibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that\\nlittle may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had\\nheard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcarâ\\x80\\x99s?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,â\\x80\\x9d said he in a crackling\\nvoice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI seeâ\\x80\\x94her ladyshipâ\\x80\\x99s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden\\nwealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for\\nbetter men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means\\nyou used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very\\npretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had\\nbeen concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would\\nrest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some\\nsmall job in my ladyâ\\x80\\x99s roomâ\\x80\\x94you and your confederate Cusackâ\\x80\\x94and you\\nmanaged that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you\\nrifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man\\narrested. You thenâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRyder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my\\ncompanionâ\\x80\\x99s knees. â\\x80\\x9cFor Godâ\\x80\\x99s sake, have mercy!â\\x80\\x9d he shrieked. â\\x80\\x9cThink of\\nmy father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I never went\\nwrong before! I never will again. I swear it. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll swear it on a Bible.\\nOh, donâ\\x80\\x99t bring it into court! For Christâ\\x80\\x99s sake, donâ\\x80\\x99t!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGet back into your chair!â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes sternly. â\\x80\\x9cIt is very well to\\ncringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner\\nin the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge\\nagainst him will break down.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of\\nthe next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose\\ninto the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope\\nof safety.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRyder passed his tongue over his parched lips. â\\x80\\x9cI will tell you it just\\nas it happened, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cWhen Horner had been arrested, it\\nseemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at\\nonce, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it\\ninto their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about the\\nhotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission, and\\nI made for my sisterâ\\x80\\x99s house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and\\nlived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the\\nway there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a\\ndetective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring\\ndown my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what\\nwas the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been\\nupset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard\\nand smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just\\nbeen serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell\\ninto talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what\\nthey stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two\\nthings about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where\\nhe lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn\\nthe stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the\\nagonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any\\nmoment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my\\nwaistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and\\nlooking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and\\nsuddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the\\nbest detective that ever lived.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of\\nher geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as\\ngood as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my\\nstone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this\\nI drove one of the birdsâ\\x80\\x94a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I\\ncaught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat\\nas far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the\\nstone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature\\nflapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the\\nmatter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered\\noff among the others.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?â\\x80\\x99 says she.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 said I, â\\x80\\x98you said youâ\\x80\\x99d give me one for Christmas, and I was\\nfeeling which was the fattest.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Oh,â\\x80\\x99 says she, â\\x80\\x98weâ\\x80\\x99ve set yours aside for youâ\\x80\\x94Jemâ\\x80\\x99s bird, we call it.\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s the big white one over yonder. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s twenty-six of them, which\\nmakes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Thank you, Maggie,â\\x80\\x99 says I; â\\x80\\x98but if it is all the same to you, Iâ\\x80\\x99d\\nrather have that one I was handling just now.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98The other is a good three pound heavier,â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98and we fattened\\nit expressly for you.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Never mind. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have the other, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll take it now,â\\x80\\x99 said I.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Oh, just as you like,â\\x80\\x99 said she, a little huffed. â\\x80\\x98Which is it you\\nwant, then?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the\\nflock.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the\\nway to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it\\nwas easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and\\nwe got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for\\nthere was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake\\nhad occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sisterâ\\x80\\x99s, and hurried\\ninto the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Where are they all, Maggie?â\\x80\\x99 I cried.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Gone to the dealerâ\\x80\\x99s, Jem.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Which dealerâ\\x80\\x99s?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98But was there another with a barred tail?â\\x80\\x99 I asked, â\\x80\\x98the same as the\\none I chose?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell\\nthem apart.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet\\nwould carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at\\nonce, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You\\nheard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like\\nthat. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am\\nmyself. And nowâ\\x80\\x94and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever\\nhaving touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me!\\nGod help me!â\\x80\\x9d He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in\\nhis hands.\\n\\nThere was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the\\nmeasured tapping of Sherlock Holmesâ\\x80\\x99 finger-tips upon the edge of the\\ntable. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGet out!â\\x80\\x9d said he.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo more words. Get out!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the\\nstairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls\\nfrom the street.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAfter all, Watson,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay\\npipe, â\\x80\\x9cI am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If\\nHorner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will\\nnot appear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am\\ncommuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul.\\nThis fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened.\\nSend him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides,\\nit is the season of forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most\\nsingular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If\\nyou will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin\\nanother investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief\\nfeature.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND\\n\\nOn glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have\\nduring the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock\\nHolmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange,\\nbut none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his\\nart than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself\\nwith any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even\\nthe fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any\\nwhich presented more singular features than that which was associated\\nwith the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The\\nevents in question occurred in the early days of my association with\\nHolmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is\\npossible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a\\npromise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been\\nfreed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom\\nthe pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now\\ncome to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread\\nrumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the\\nmatter even more terrible than the truth.\\n\\nIt was early in April in the year â\\x80\\x9983 that I woke one morning to find\\nSherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was\\na late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me\\nthat it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some\\nsurprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself\\nregular in my habits.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery sorry to knock you up, Watson,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cbut itâ\\x80\\x99s the common lot\\nthis morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me,\\nand I on you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is it, thenâ\\x80\\x94a fire?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable\\nstate of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in\\nthe sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at\\nthis hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds,\\nI presume that it is something very pressing which they have to\\ncommunicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am\\nsure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I\\nshould call you and give you the chance.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional\\ninvestigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as\\nintuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he\\nunravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on\\nmy clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down\\nto the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who\\nhad been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood-morning, madam,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes cheerily. â\\x80\\x9cMy name is Sherlock\\nHolmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before\\nwhom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see\\nthat Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up\\nto it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that\\nyou are shivering.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is not cold which makes me shiver,â\\x80\\x9d said the woman in a low voice,\\nchanging her seat as requested.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.â\\x80\\x9d She raised her veil as she\\nspoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of\\nagitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes,\\nlike those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of\\na woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her\\nexpression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one\\nof his quick, all-comprehensive glances.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou must not fear,â\\x80\\x9d said he soothingly, bending forward and patting\\nher forearm. â\\x80\\x9cWe shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You\\nhave come in by train this morning, I see.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou know me, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of\\nyour left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good\\ndrive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the\\nstation.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my\\ncompanion.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is no mystery, my dear madam,â\\x80\\x9d said he, smiling. â\\x80\\x9cThe left arm\\nof your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The\\nmarks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which\\nthrows up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand\\nside of the driver.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,â\\x80\\x9d said she. â\\x80\\x9cI\\nstarted from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and\\ncame in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no\\nlonger; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn toâ\\x80\\x94none,\\nsave only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little\\naid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs.\\nFarintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from\\nher that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could\\nhelp me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense\\ndarkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward\\nyou for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married,\\nwith the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find\\nme ungrateful.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHolmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small\\ncase-book, which he consulted.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFarintosh,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cAh yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with\\nan opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say,\\nmadam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I\\ndid to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own\\nreward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put\\nto, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay\\nbefore us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the\\nmatter.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAlas!â\\x80\\x9d replied our visitor, â\\x80\\x9cthe very horror of my situation lies in\\nthe fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so\\nentirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that\\neven he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and\\nadvice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a\\nnervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing\\nanswers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can\\nsee deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may\\nadvise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am all attention, madam.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is\\nthe last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the\\nRoylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHolmes nodded his head. â\\x80\\x9cThe name is familiar to me,â\\x80\\x9d said he.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe family was at one time among the richest in England, and the\\nestates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and\\nHampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive\\nheirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin\\nwas eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency.\\nNothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the\\ntwo-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy\\nmortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the\\nhorrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my\\nstepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions,\\nobtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a\\nmedical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional\\nskill and his force of character, he established a large practice. In a\\nfit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been\\nperpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and\\nnarrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term\\nof imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and\\ndisappointed man.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the\\nyoung widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister\\nJulia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of\\nmy motherâ\\x80\\x99s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of moneyâ\\x80\\x94not less\\nthan Â£ 1000 a yearâ\\x80\\x94and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely\\nwhile we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum\\nshould be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly\\nafter our return to England my mother diedâ\\x80\\x94she was killed eight years\\nago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his\\nattempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live\\nwith him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my\\nmother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no\\nobstacle to our happiness.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time.\\nInstead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours,\\nwho had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in\\nthe old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came\\nout save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his\\npath. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in\\nthe men of the family, and in my stepfatherâ\\x80\\x99s case it had, I believe,\\nbeen intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of\\ndisgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court,\\nuntil at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would\\nfly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and\\nabsolutely uncontrollable in his anger.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLast week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream,\\nand it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather\\ntogether that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no\\nfriends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these\\nvagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land\\nwhich represent the family estate, and would accept in return the\\nhospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for\\nweeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent\\nover to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and\\na baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the\\nvillagers almost as much as their master.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no\\ngreat pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a\\nlong time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the\\ntime of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even\\nas mine has.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour sister is dead, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to\\nspeak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I have\\ndescribed, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and\\nposition. We had, however, an aunt, my motherâ\\x80\\x99s maiden sister, Miss\\nHonoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally\\nallowed to pay short visits at this ladyâ\\x80\\x99s house. Julia went there at\\nChristmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to\\nwhom she became engaged. My stepfather learned of the engagement when\\nmy sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within\\na fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the\\nterrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed\\nand his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and\\nglanced across at his visitor.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPray be precise as to details,â\\x80\\x9d said he.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is\\nseared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very\\nold, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are\\non the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of\\nthe buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylottâ\\x80\\x99s, the second\\nmy sisterâ\\x80\\x99s, and the third my own. There is no communication between\\nthem, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself\\nplain?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerfectly so.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal\\nnight Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he\\nhad not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the\\nstrong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left her\\nroom, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time,\\nchatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven oâ\\x80\\x99clock she rose to\\nleave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Tell me, Helen,â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98have you ever heard anyone whistle in the\\ndead of the night?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Never,â\\x80\\x99 said I.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your\\nsleep?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Certainly not. But why?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the\\nmorning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has\\nawakened me. I cannot tell where it came fromâ\\x80\\x94perhaps from the next\\nroom, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you\\nwhether you had heard it.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did\\nnot hear it also.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.â\\x80\\x99 She smiled back at\\nme, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the\\nlock.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIndeed,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes. â\\x80\\x9cWas it your custom always to lock yourselves in\\nat night?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAlways.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd why?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think that I mentioned to you that the Doctor kept a cheetah and a\\nbaboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite so. Pray proceed with your statement.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune\\nimpressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you\\nknow how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely\\nallied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain\\nwas beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the\\nhubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified\\nwoman. I knew that it was my sisterâ\\x80\\x99s voice. I sprang from my bed,\\nwrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my\\ndoor I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a\\nfew moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen.\\nAs I ran down the passage, my sisterâ\\x80\\x99s door was unlocked, and revolved\\nslowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing\\nwhat was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I\\nsaw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her\\nhands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that\\nof a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that\\nmoment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She\\nwrithed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully\\nconvulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I\\nbent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never\\nforget, â\\x80\\x98Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!â\\x80\\x99 There\\nwas something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with\\nher finger into the air in the direction of the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s room, but a\\nfresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling\\nloudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his\\ndressing-gown. When he reached my sisterâ\\x80\\x99s side she was unconscious,\\nand though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid\\nfrom the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and\\ndied without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful\\nend of my beloved sister.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne moment,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, â\\x80\\x9care you sure about this whistle and\\nmetallic sound? Could you swear to it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my\\nstrong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale\\nand the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWas your sister dressed?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the\\ncharred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShowing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the\\nalarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the\\ncoroner come to?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylottâ\\x80\\x99s conduct\\nhad long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any\\nsatisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been\\nfastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by\\nold-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every\\nnight. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite\\nsolid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with\\nthe same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large\\nstaples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when\\nshe met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon\\nher.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow about poison?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe doctors examined her for it, but without success.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though\\nwhat it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWere there gipsies in the plantation at the time?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, there are nearly always some there.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, and what did you gather from this allusion to a bandâ\\x80\\x94a speckled\\nband?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium,\\nsometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to\\nthese very gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted\\nhandkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have\\nsuggested the strange adjective which she used.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHolmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThese are very deep waters,â\\x80\\x9d said he; â\\x80\\x9cpray go on with your\\nnarrative.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTwo years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately\\nlonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have\\nknown for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in\\nmarriage. His name is Armitageâ\\x80\\x94Percy Armitageâ\\x80\\x94the second son of Mr.\\nArmitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no\\nopposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the\\nspring. Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the\\nbuilding, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to\\nmove into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very\\nbed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last\\nnight, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly\\nheard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the\\nherald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was\\nto be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however,\\nso I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a\\ndog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead,\\nfrom whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing\\nyou and asking your advice.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have done wisely,â\\x80\\x9d said my friend. â\\x80\\x9cBut have you told me all?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMiss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, what do you mean?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFor answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the\\nhand that lay upon our visitorâ\\x80\\x99s knee. Five little livid spots, the\\nmarks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have been cruelly used,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes.\\n\\nThe lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. â\\x80\\x9cHe is a\\nhard man,â\\x80\\x9d she said, â\\x80\\x9cand perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his\\nhands and stared into the crackling fire.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is a very deep business,â\\x80\\x9d he said at last. â\\x80\\x9cThere are a thousand\\ndetails which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course\\nof action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to\\nStoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms\\nwithout the knowledge of your stepfather?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most\\nimportant business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and\\nthat there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now,\\nbut she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBy no means.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in\\ntown. But I shall return by the twelve oâ\\x80\\x99clock train, so as to be there\\nin time for your coming.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small\\nbusiness matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my\\ntrouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this\\nafternoon.â\\x80\\x9d She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided\\nfrom the room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd what do you think of it all, Watson?â\\x80\\x9d asked Sherlock Holmes,\\nleaning back in his chair.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDark enough and sinister enough.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are\\nsound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her\\nsister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious\\nend.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very\\npeculiar words of the dying woman?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI cannot think.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a\\nband of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the\\nfact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an\\ninterest in preventing his stepdaughterâ\\x80\\x99s marriage, the dying allusion\\nto a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a\\nmetallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars\\nthat secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that\\nthere is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along\\nthose lines.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what, then, did the gipsies do?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI cannot imagine.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see many objections to any such theory.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to\\nStoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal,\\nor if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our\\ndoor had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed\\nhimself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the\\nprofessional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long\\nfrock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in\\nhis hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of\\nthe doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to\\nside. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with\\nthe sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the\\nother of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,\\nfleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird\\nof prey.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhich of you is Holmes?â\\x80\\x9d asked this apparition.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,â\\x80\\x9d said my companion\\nquietly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIndeed, Doctor,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes blandly. â\\x80\\x9cPray take a seat.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have\\ntraced her. What has she been saying to you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is a little cold for the time of the year,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat has she been saying to you?â\\x80\\x9d screamed the old man furiously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I have heard that the crocuses promise well,â\\x80\\x9d continued my\\ncompanion imperturbably.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHa! You put me off, do you?â\\x80\\x9d said our new visitor, taking a step\\nforward and shaking his hunting-crop. â\\x80\\x9cI know you, you scoundrel! I\\nhave heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMy friend smiled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHolmes, the busybody!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHis smile broadened.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHolmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHolmes chuckled heartily. â\\x80\\x9cYour conversation is most entertaining,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid he. â\\x80\\x9cWhen you go out close the door, for there is a decided\\ndraught.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will go when I have had my say. Donâ\\x80\\x99t you dare to meddle with my\\naffairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a\\ndangerous man to fall foul of! See here.â\\x80\\x9d He stepped swiftly forward,\\nseized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSee that you keep yourself out of my grip,â\\x80\\x9d he snarled, and hurling\\nthe twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe seems a very amiable person,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, laughing. â\\x80\\x9cI am not\\nquite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my\\ngrip was not much more feeble than his own.â\\x80\\x9d As he spoke he picked up\\nthe steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official\\ndetective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation,\\nhowever, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from\\nher imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we\\nshall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctorsâ\\x80\\x99\\nCommons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this\\nmatter.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was nearly one oâ\\x80\\x99clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his\\nexcursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over\\nwith notes and figures.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have seen the will of the deceased wife,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cTo determine its\\nexact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the\\ninvestments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the\\ntime of the wifeâ\\x80\\x99s death was little short of Â£ 1,100, is now, through\\nthe fall in agricultural prices, not more than Â£ 750. Each daughter can\\nclaim an income of Â£ 250, in case of marriage. It is evident,\\ntherefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a\\nmere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very\\nserious extent. My morningâ\\x80\\x99s work has not been wasted, since it has\\nproved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way\\nof anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for\\ndawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting\\nourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and\\ndrive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your\\nrevolver into your pocket. An Eleyâ\\x80\\x99s No. 2 is an excellent argument\\nwith gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a\\ntooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAt Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead,\\nwhere we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five\\nmiles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a\\nbright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and\\nwayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the\\nair was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at least\\nthere was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring\\nand this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in\\nthe front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his\\neyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought.\\nSuddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed\\nover the meadows.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook there!â\\x80\\x9d said he.\\n\\nA heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into\\na grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out\\nthe grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStoke Moran?â\\x80\\x9d said he.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,â\\x80\\x9d remarked the\\ndriver.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is some building going on there,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes; â\\x80\\x9cthat is where we\\nare going.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s the village,â\\x80\\x9d said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs\\nsome distance to the left; â\\x80\\x9cbut if you want to get to the house, youâ\\x80\\x99ll\\nfind it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the footpath over the\\nfields. There it is, where the lady is walking.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,â\\x80\\x9d observed Holmes, shading his\\neyes. â\\x80\\x9cYes, I think we had better do as you suggest.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to\\nLeatherhead.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought it as well,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes as we climbed the stile, â\\x80\\x9cthat this\\nfellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite\\nbusiness. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see\\nthat we have been as good as our word.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOur client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face\\nwhich spoke her joy. â\\x80\\x9cI have been waiting so eagerly for you,â\\x80\\x9d she\\ncried, shaking hands with us warmly. â\\x80\\x9cAll has turned out splendidly.\\nDr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back\\nbefore evening.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe have had the pleasure of making the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s acquaintance,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nHolmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss\\nStoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood heavens!â\\x80\\x9d she cried, â\\x80\\x9che has followed me, then.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo it appears.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will\\nhe say when he returns?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more\\ncunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him\\nto-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your auntâ\\x80\\x99s at\\nHarrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us\\nat once to the rooms which we are to examine.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central\\nportion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on\\neach side. In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked\\nwith wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of\\nruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but the\\nright-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the\\nwindows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that\\nthis was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected\\nagainst the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but\\nthere were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes\\nwalked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep\\nattention the outsides of the windows.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the\\ncentre one to your sisterâ\\x80\\x99s, and the one next to the main building to\\nDr. Roylottâ\\x80\\x99s chamber?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not\\nseem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my\\nroom.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing\\nruns the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows\\nin it, of course?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable\\nfrom that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room\\nand bar your shutters?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the\\nopen window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but\\nwithout success. There was no slit through which a knife could be\\npassed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but\\nthey were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. â\\x80\\x9cHum!â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, â\\x80\\x9cmy theory certainly\\npresents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they\\nwere bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the\\nmatter.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the\\nthree bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so\\nwe passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now\\nsleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a\\nhomely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after\\nthe fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in\\none corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a\\ndressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles,\\nwith two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the\\nroom save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round\\nand the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old\\nand discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of\\nthe house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent,\\nwhile his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in\\nevery detail of the apartment.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere does that bell communicate with?â\\x80\\x9d he asked at last pointing to a\\nthick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually\\nlying upon the pillow.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt goes to the housekeeperâ\\x80\\x99s room.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt looks newer than the other things?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour sister asked for it, I suppose?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we\\nwanted for ourselves.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIndeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You\\nwill excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this\\nfloor.â\\x80\\x9d He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand\\nand crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks\\nbetween the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which\\nthe chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed and spent\\nsome time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall.\\nFinally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, itâ\\x80\\x99s a dummy,â\\x80\\x9d said he.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWonâ\\x80\\x99t it ring?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You\\ncan see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little\\nopening for the ventilator is.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow very absurd! I never noticed that before.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery strange!â\\x80\\x9d muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. â\\x80\\x9cThere are one or\\ntwo very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a\\nbuilder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the\\nsame trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is also quite modern,â\\x80\\x9d said the lady.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDone about the same time as the bell-rope?â\\x80\\x9d remarked Holmes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey seem to have been of a most interesting characterâ\\x80\\x94dummy\\nbell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your\\npermission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the\\ninner apartment.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDr. Grimesby Roylottâ\\x80\\x99s chamber was larger than that of his\\nstep-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden\\nshelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair\\nbeside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table,\\nand a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye.\\nHolmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the\\nkeenest interest.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s in here?â\\x80\\x9d he asked, tapping the safe.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy stepfatherâ\\x80\\x99s business papers.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! you have seen inside, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOnly once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere isnâ\\x80\\x99t a cat in it, for example?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo. What a strange idea!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, look at this!â\\x80\\x9d He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on\\nthe top of it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo; we donâ\\x80\\x99t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a\\nsaucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay.\\nThere is one point which I should wish to determine.â\\x80\\x9d He squatted down\\nin front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the\\ngreatest attention.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you. That is quite settled,â\\x80\\x9d said he, rising and putting his\\nlens in his pocket. â\\x80\\x9cHullo! Here is something interesting!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one\\ncorner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied\\nso as to make a loop of whipcord.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you make of that, Watson?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a common enough lash. But I donâ\\x80\\x99t know why it should be tied.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! itâ\\x80\\x99s a wicked world, and\\nwhen a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I\\nthink that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your\\npermission we shall walk out upon the lawn.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI had never seen my friendâ\\x80\\x99s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was\\nwhen we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked\\nseveral times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself\\nliking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his\\nreverie.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is very essential, Miss Stoner,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cthat you should\\nabsolutely follow my advice in every respect.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI shall most certainly do so.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend\\nupon your compliance.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI assure you that I am in your hands.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your\\nroom.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBoth Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village\\ninn over there?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, that is the Crown.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery good. Your windows would be visible from there?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache,\\nwhen your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the\\nnight, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put\\nyour lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with\\neverything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to\\noccupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage\\nthere for one night.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes, easily.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe rest you will leave in our hands.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what will you do?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the\\ncause of this noise which has disturbed you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nMiss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companionâ\\x80\\x99s sleeve.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps I have.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen, for pityâ\\x80\\x99s sake, tell me what was the cause of my sisterâ\\x80\\x99s\\ndeath.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she\\ndied from some sudden fright.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more\\ntangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr.\\nRoylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and\\nbe brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured\\nthat we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and\\nsitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from\\nour window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the\\ninhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby\\nRoylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure\\nof the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing\\nthe heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s\\nvoice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him.\\nThe trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring\\nup among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you know, Watson,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering\\ndarkness, â\\x80\\x9cI have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There\\nis a distinct element of danger.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCan I be of assistance?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour presence might be invaluable.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen I shall certainly come.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is very kind of you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than\\nwas visible to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that\\nyou saw all that I did.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that\\ncould answer I confess is more than I can imagine.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou saw the ventilator, too?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a\\nsmall opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could\\nhardly pass through.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke\\nMoran.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear Holmes!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister\\ncould smell Dr. Roylottâ\\x80\\x99s cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once\\nthat there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only\\nbe a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coronerâ\\x80\\x99s\\ninquiry. I deduced a ventilator.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what harm can there be in that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator\\nis made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does\\nnot that strike you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI cannot as yet see any connection.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that\\nbefore?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI cannot say that I have.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same\\nrelative position to the ventilator and to the ropeâ\\x80\\x94or so we may call\\nit, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHolmes,â\\x80\\x9d I cried, â\\x80\\x9cI seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are\\nonly just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSubtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is\\nthe first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and\\nPritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes\\neven deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike\\ndeeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is\\nover; for goodnessâ\\x80\\x99 sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds\\nfor a few hours to something more cheerful.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAbout nine oâ\\x80\\x99clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all\\nwas dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly\\naway, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright\\nlight shone out right in front of us.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is our signal,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, springing to his feet; â\\x80\\x9cit comes\\nfrom the middle window.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining\\nthat we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was\\npossible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were\\nout on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow\\nlight twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our\\nsombre errand.\\n\\nThere was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired\\nbreaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we\\nreached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the\\nwindow when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed\\nto be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass\\nwith writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the\\ndarkness.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy God!â\\x80\\x9d I whispered; â\\x80\\x9cdid you see it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHolmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice\\nupon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put\\nhis lips to my ear.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is a nice household,â\\x80\\x9d he murmured. â\\x80\\x9cThat is the baboon.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI had forgotten the strange pets which the Doctor affected. There was a\\ncheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any\\nmoment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following\\nHolmesâ\\x80\\x99 example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the\\nbedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp\\nonto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had\\nseen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of\\nhis hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that\\nI could do to distinguish the words:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe least sound would be fatal to our plans.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI nodded to show that I had heard.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI nodded again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol\\nready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and\\nyou in that chair.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.\\n\\nHolmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed\\nbeside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle.\\nThen he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.\\n\\nHow shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound,\\nnot even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat\\nopen-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous\\ntension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of\\nlight, and we waited in absolute darkness.\\n\\nFrom outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our\\nvery window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah\\nwas indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the\\nparish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they\\nseemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and\\nstill we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.\\n\\nSuddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction\\nof the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a\\nstrong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room\\nhad lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then\\nall was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an\\nhour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became\\naudibleâ\\x80\\x94a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of\\nsteam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it,\\nHolmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with\\nhis cane at the bell-pull.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou see it, Watson?â\\x80\\x9d he yelled. â\\x80\\x9cYou see it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a\\nlow, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes\\nmade it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed\\nso savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and\\nfilled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing\\nup at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the\\nnight the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled\\nup louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all\\nmingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the\\nvillage, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the\\nsleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood\\ngazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died\\naway into the silence from which it rose.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat can it mean?â\\x80\\x9d I gasped.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt means that it is all over,â\\x80\\x9d Holmes answered. â\\x80\\x9cAnd perhaps, after\\nall, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr.\\nRoylottâ\\x80\\x99s room.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWith a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor.\\nTwice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then\\nhe turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked\\npistol in my hand.\\n\\nIt was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a\\ndark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of\\nlight upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this\\ntable, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long\\ngrey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet\\nthrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short\\nstock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin\\nwas cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at\\nthe corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow\\nband, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round\\nhis head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe band! the speckled band!â\\x80\\x9d whispered Holmes.\\n\\nI took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to\\nmove, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat\\ndiamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is a swamp adder!â\\x80\\x9d cried Holmes; â\\x80\\x9cthe deadliest snake in India. He\\nhas died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth,\\nrecoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he\\ndigs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we\\ncan then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county\\npolice know what has happened.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead manâ\\x80\\x99s lap, and\\nthrowing the noose round the reptileâ\\x80\\x99s neck he drew it from its horrid\\nperch and, carrying it at armâ\\x80\\x99s length, threw it into the iron safe,\\nwhich he closed upon it.\\n\\nSuch are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke\\nMoran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has\\nalready run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news\\nto the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the\\ncare of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official\\ninquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while\\nindiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet\\nto learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled\\nback next day.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI had,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9ccome to an entirely erroneous conclusion which\\nshows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from\\ninsufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word\\nâ\\x80\\x98band,â\\x80\\x99 which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the\\nappearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of\\nher match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I\\ncan only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position\\nwhen, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an\\noccupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door.\\nMy attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to\\nthis ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The\\ndiscovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the\\nfloor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as\\na bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed.\\nThe idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it\\nwith my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of\\ncreatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track.\\nThe idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be\\ndiscovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a\\nclever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity\\nwith which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point\\nof view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who\\ncould distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where\\nthe poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of\\ncourse he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to\\nthe victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we\\nsaw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this\\nventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it\\nwould crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not\\nbite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but\\nsooner or later she must fall a victim.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An\\ninspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of\\nstanding on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he\\nshould reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk,\\nand the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which\\nmay have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was\\nobviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe\\nupon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the\\nsteps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the\\ncreature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit\\nthe light and attacked it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWith the result of driving it through the ventilator.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the\\nother side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its\\nsnakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this\\nway I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylottâ\\x80\\x99s\\ndeath, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my\\nconscience.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\nIX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEERâ\\x80\\x99S THUMB\\n\\nOf all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr.\\nSherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there\\nwere only two which I was the means of introducing to his noticeâ\\x80\\x94that\\nof Mr. Hatherleyâ\\x80\\x99s thumb, and that of Colonel Warburtonâ\\x80\\x99s madness. Of\\nthese the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and\\noriginal observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so\\ndramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed\\nupon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those\\ndeductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable\\nresults. The story has, I believe, been told more than once in the\\nnewspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less\\nstriking when set forth _en bloc_ in a single half-column of print than\\nwhen the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery\\nclears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which\\nleads on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a\\ndeep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served\\nto weaken the effect.\\n\\nIt was in the summer of â\\x80\\x9989, not long after my marriage, that the\\nevents occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned to\\ncivil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street\\nrooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally even\\npersuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit\\nus. My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no\\nvery great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from\\namong the officials. One of these, whom I had cured of a painful and\\nlingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues and of\\nendeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any\\ninfluence.\\n\\nOne morning, at a little before seven oâ\\x80\\x99clock, I was awakened by the\\nmaid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from\\nPaddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed\\nhurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom\\ntrivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my old ally, the\\nguard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve got him here,â\\x80\\x9d he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cheâ\\x80\\x99s all right.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is it, then?â\\x80\\x9d I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some\\nstrange creature which he had caged up in my room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a new patient,â\\x80\\x9d he whispered. â\\x80\\x9cI thought Iâ\\x80\\x99d bring him round\\nmyself; then he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t slip away. There he is, all safe and sound. I\\nmust go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you.â\\x80\\x9d And off\\nhe went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.\\n\\nI entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table.\\nHe was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap\\nwhich he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his hands he had a\\nhandkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He\\nwas young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong,\\nmasculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression\\nof a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took\\nall his strength of mind to control.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cbut I have had\\na very serious accident during the night. I came in by train this\\nmorning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a\\ndoctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a\\ncard, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI took it up and glanced at it. â\\x80\\x9cMr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic\\nengineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor).â\\x80\\x9d That was the name, style,\\nand abode of my morning visitor. â\\x80\\x9cI regret that I have kept you\\nwaiting,â\\x80\\x9d said I, sitting down in my library-chair. â\\x80\\x9cYou are fresh from\\na night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous\\noccupation.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, my night could not be called monotonous,â\\x80\\x9d said he, and laughed. He\\nlaughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his\\nchair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against\\nthat laugh.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStop it!â\\x80\\x9d I cried; â\\x80\\x9cpull yourself together!â\\x80\\x9d and I poured out some\\nwater from a caraffe.\\n\\nIt was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical\\noutbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is\\nover and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and\\npale-looking.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have been making a fool of myself,â\\x80\\x9d he gasped.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot at all. Drink this.â\\x80\\x9d I dashed some brandy into the water, and the\\ncolour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s better!â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cAnd now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly\\nattend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my\\nhardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding\\nfingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have\\nbeen. It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood heavens!â\\x80\\x9d I cried, â\\x80\\x9cthis is a terrible injury. It must have bled\\nconsiderably.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have\\nbeen senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that it was\\nstill bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round\\nthe wrist and braced it up with a twig.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcellent! You should have been a surgeon.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own\\nprovince.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis has been done,â\\x80\\x9d said I, examining the wound, â\\x80\\x9cby a very heavy and\\nsharp instrument.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA thing like a cleaver,â\\x80\\x9d said he.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAn accident, I presume?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBy no means.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat! a murderous attack?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery murderous indeed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou horrify me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it\\nover with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back without\\nwincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow is that?â\\x80\\x9d I asked when I had finished.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCapital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. I was\\nvery weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying\\nto your nerves.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but,\\nbetween ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this\\nwound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, for\\nit is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof\\nwith which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which\\nI can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will\\nbe done.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHa!â\\x80\\x9d cried I, â\\x80\\x9cif it is anything in the nature of a problem which you\\ndesire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my\\nfriend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the official police.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I have heard of that fellow,â\\x80\\x9d answered my visitor, â\\x80\\x9cand I should\\nbe very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must\\nuse the official police as well. Would you give me an introduction to\\nhim?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll do better. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll take you round to him myself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should be immensely obliged to you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to have a\\nlittle breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an\\ninstant.â\\x80\\x9d I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife,\\nand in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new\\nacquaintance to Baker Street.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in\\nhis dressing-gown, reading the agony column of _The Times_ and smoking\\nhis before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and\\ndottles left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and\\ncollected on the corner of the mantelpiece. He received us in his\\nquietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us\\nin a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance\\nupon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of\\nbrandy and water within his reach.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr.\\nHatherley,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cPray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely\\nat home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up\\nyour strength with a little stimulant.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you,â\\x80\\x9d said my patient, â\\x80\\x9cbut I have felt another man since the\\ndoctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the\\ncure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I\\nshall start at once upon my peculiar experiences.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHolmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression\\nwhich veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him,\\nand we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor\\ndetailed to us.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou must know,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cthat I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing\\nalone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a hydraulic engineer,\\nand I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven\\nyears that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm,\\nof Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having also\\ncome into a fair sum of money through my poor fatherâ\\x80\\x99s death, I\\ndetermined to start in business for myself and took professional\\nchambers in Victoria Street.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business\\na dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two\\nyears I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is\\nabsolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings\\namount to Â£ 27 10_s_. Every day, from nine in the morning until four in\\nthe afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began\\nto sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at\\nall.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my\\nclerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me\\nupon business. He brought up a card, too, with the name of â\\x80\\x98Colonel\\nLysander Starkâ\\x80\\x99 engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel\\nhimself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding\\nthinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole\\nface sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was\\ndrawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation\\nseemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was\\nbright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but\\nneatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than\\nthirty.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Mr. Hatherley?â\\x80\\x99 said he, with something of a German accent. â\\x80\\x98You have\\nbeen recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not only\\nproficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of\\npreserving a secret.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an\\naddress. â\\x80\\x98May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at\\nthis moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan\\nand a bachelor and are residing alone in London.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98That is quite correct,â\\x80\\x99 I answered; â\\x80\\x98but you will excuse me if I say\\nthat I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional\\nqualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter that\\nyou wished to speak to me?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the\\npoint. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy\\nis quite essentialâ\\x80\\x94absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we\\nmay expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in\\nthe bosom of his family.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98If I promise to keep a secret,â\\x80\\x99 said I, â\\x80\\x98you may absolutely depend\\nupon my doing so.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had\\nnever seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Do you promise, then?â\\x80\\x99 said he at last.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Yes, I promise.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference\\nto the matter at all, either in word or writing?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I have already given you my word.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Very good.â\\x80\\x99 He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across\\nthe room he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Thatâ\\x80\\x99s all right,â\\x80\\x99 said he, coming back. â\\x80\\x98I know that clerks are\\nsometimes curious as to their masterâ\\x80\\x99s affairs. Now we can talk in\\nsafety.â\\x80\\x99 He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at\\nme again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to\\nrise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. Even my\\ndread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my\\nimpatience.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I beg that you will state your business, sir,â\\x80\\x99 said I; â\\x80\\x98my time is of\\nvalue.â\\x80\\x99 Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to\\nmy lips.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98How would fifty guineas for a nightâ\\x80\\x99s work suit you?â\\x80\\x99 he asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Most admirably.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I say a nightâ\\x80\\x99s work, but an hourâ\\x80\\x99s would be nearer the mark. I\\nsimply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has\\ngot out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it\\nright ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Where to?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of\\nOxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from\\nPaddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Very good.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98There is a drive, then?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good seven\\nmiles from Eyford Station.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there would\\nbe no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the night.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense\\nyou for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and\\nunknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of\\nyour profession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the\\nbusiness, there is plenty of time to do so.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be\\nto me. â\\x80\\x98Not at all,â\\x80\\x99 said I, â\\x80\\x98I shall be very happy to accommodate\\nmyself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a little\\nmore clearly what it is that you wish me to do.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have\\nexacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I have no wish to\\ncommit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. I\\nsuppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Entirely.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that\\nfullerâ\\x80\\x99s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one\\nor two places in England?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I have heard so.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Some little time ago I bought a small placeâ\\x80\\x94a very small placeâ\\x80\\x94within\\nten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover that there was\\na deposit of fullerâ\\x80\\x99s-earth in one of my fields. On examining it,\\nhowever, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and\\nthat it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right\\nand leftâ\\x80\\x94both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These\\ngood people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that\\nwhich was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my\\ninterest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but\\nunfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I took a few\\nof my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we\\nshould quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in\\nthis way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the\\nneighbouring fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and in\\norder to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This\\npress, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish\\nyour advice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously,\\nhowever, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers\\ncoming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if\\nthe facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these\\nfields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you promise\\nme that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford\\nto-night. I hope that I make it all plain?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I quite follow you,â\\x80\\x99 said I. â\\x80\\x98The only point which I could not quite\\nunderstand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in\\nexcavating fullerâ\\x80\\x99s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like\\ngravel from a pit.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Ah!â\\x80\\x99 said he carelessly, â\\x80\\x98we have our own process. We compress the\\nearth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they\\nare. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my\\nconfidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.â\\x80\\x99\\nHe rose as he spoke. â\\x80\\x98I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I shall certainly be there.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98And not a word to a soul.â\\x80\\x99 He looked at me with a last long,\\nquestioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he\\nhurried from the room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much\\nastonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had\\nbeen intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the\\nfee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price\\nupon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to\\nother ones. On the other hand, the face and manner of my patron had\\nmade an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that his\\nexplanation of the fullerâ\\x80\\x99s-earth was sufficient to explain the\\nnecessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I\\nshould tell anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the\\nwinds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off,\\nhaving obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station.\\nHowever, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the\\nlittle dim-lit station after eleven oâ\\x80\\x99clock. I was the only passenger\\nwho got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single\\nsleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate,\\nhowever, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow\\nupon the other side. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me\\ninto a carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the\\nwindows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as\\nfast as the horse could go.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne horse?â\\x80\\x9d interjected Holmes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, only one.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you observe the colour?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the\\ncarriage. It was a chestnut.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTired-looking or fresh?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, fresh and glossy.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most\\ninteresting statement.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAway we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander\\nStark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from\\nthe rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it\\nmust have been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the\\ntime, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction,\\nthat he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads seem\\nto be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and\\njolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of\\nwhere we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make\\nout nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now and\\nthen I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but\\nthe colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon\\nflagged. At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for\\nthe crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a\\nstand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him,\\npulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We stepped,\\nas it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I\\nfailed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The\\ninstant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily\\nbehind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage\\ndrove away.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about\\nlooking for matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door\\nopened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light\\nshot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a\\nlamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face\\nforward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and from\\nthe gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it\\nwas a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a\\ntone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a\\ngruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from\\nher hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear,\\nand then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he\\nwalked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few\\nminutes,â\\x80\\x99 said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little,\\nplainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which\\nseveral German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp\\non the top of a harmonium beside the door. â\\x80\\x98I shall not keep you\\nwaiting an instant,â\\x80\\x99 said he, and vanished into the darkness.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of\\nGerman I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the\\nothers being volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window,\\nhoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak\\nshutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully\\nsilent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the\\npassage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of\\nuneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and\\nwhat were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And\\nwhere was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I\\nknew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that\\nmatter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that\\nradius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was\\nquite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the\\ncountry. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath\\nto keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my\\nfifty-guinea fee.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSuddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter\\nstillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was\\nstanding in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the\\nyellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I\\ncould see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a\\nchill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be\\nsilent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her\\neyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom\\nbehind her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I would go,â\\x80\\x99 said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak\\ncalmly; â\\x80\\x98I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you\\nto do.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98But, madam,â\\x80\\x99 said I, â\\x80\\x98I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot\\npossibly leave until I have seen the machine.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98It is not worth your while to wait,â\\x80\\x99 she went on. â\\x80\\x98You can pass\\nthrough the door; no one hinders.â\\x80\\x99 And then, seeing that I smiled and\\nshook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step\\nforward, with her hands wrung together. â\\x80\\x98For the love of Heaven!â\\x80\\x99 she\\nwhispered, â\\x80\\x98get away from here before it is too late!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage\\nin an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my\\nfifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night\\nwhich seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should\\nI slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the\\npayment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a\\nmonomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had\\nshaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and\\ndeclared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew\\nher entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several\\nfootsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw\\nup her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as\\nnoiselessly as she had come.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a\\nchinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was\\nintroduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98This is my secretary and manager,â\\x80\\x99 said the colonel. â\\x80\\x98By the way, I\\nwas under the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear\\nthat you have felt the draught.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98On the contrary,â\\x80\\x99 said I, â\\x80\\x98I opened the door myself because I felt\\nthe room to be a little close.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe shot one of his suspicious looks at me. â\\x80\\x98Perhaps we had better\\nproceed to business, then,â\\x80\\x99 said he. â\\x80\\x98Mr. Ferguson and I will take you\\nup to see the machine.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I had better put my hat on, I suppose.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Oh, no, it is in the house.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98What, you dig fullerâ\\x80\\x99s-earth in the house?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All\\nwe wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is\\nwrong with it.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat\\nmanager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with\\ncorridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors,\\nthe thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had\\ncrossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above\\nthe ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the\\ndamp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put\\non as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the\\nwarnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen\\neye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent\\nman, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least\\na fellow-countryman.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cColonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he\\nunlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us\\ncould hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the\\ncolonel ushered me in.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98We are now,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98actually within the hydraulic press, and it\\nwould be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn\\nit on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the\\ndescending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon\\nthis metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside\\nwhich receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the\\nmanner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but\\nthere is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little\\nof its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to\\nshow us how we can set it right.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly.\\nIt was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous\\npressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers\\nwhich controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there\\nwas a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through\\none of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the\\nindia-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk\\nso as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was\\nclearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my\\ncompanions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several\\npractical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When\\nI had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the\\nmachine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was\\nobvious at a glance that the story of the fullerâ\\x80\\x99s-earth was the merest\\nfabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an\\nengine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of\\nwood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came\\nto examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I\\nhad stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I\\nheard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of\\nthe colonel looking down at me.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98What are you doing there?â\\x80\\x99 he asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that\\nwhich he had told me. â\\x80\\x98I was admiring your fullerâ\\x80\\x99s-earth,â\\x80\\x99 said I; â\\x80\\x98I\\nthink that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if\\nI knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my\\nspeech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey\\neyes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Very well,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98you shall know all about the machine.â\\x80\\x99 He took\\na step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the\\nlock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite\\nsecure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. â\\x80\\x98Hullo!â\\x80\\x99\\nI yelled. â\\x80\\x98Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart\\ninto my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the\\nleaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood\\nupon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its\\nlight I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly,\\njerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must\\nwithin a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself,\\nscreaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I\\nimplored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the\\nlevers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my\\nhead, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface.\\nThen it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend\\nvery much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the\\nweight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that\\ndreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve\\nto lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me?\\nAlready I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which\\nbrought a gush of hope back to my heart.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls\\nwere of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line\\nof yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and\\nbroadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could\\nhardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death.\\nThe next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the\\nother side. The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the\\nlamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal,\\ntold me how narrow had been my escape.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I\\nfound myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a\\nwoman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held\\na candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had\\nso foolishly rejected.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Come! come!â\\x80\\x99 she cried breathlessly. â\\x80\\x98They will be here in a moment.\\nThey will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious\\ntime, but come!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my\\nfeet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The\\nlatter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard\\nthe sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering\\nthe other from the floor on which  we were and from the one beneath. My\\nguide stopped and looked about her like one  who is at her witâ\\x80\\x99s end.\\nThen she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window\\nof which the moon was shining brightly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98It is your only chance,â\\x80\\x99 said she. â\\x80\\x98It is high, but it may be that\\nyou can jump it.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the\\npassage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing\\nforward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcherâ\\x80\\x99s\\ncleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the\\nwindow, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden\\nlooked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet\\ndown. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I\\nshould have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who\\npursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to\\ngo back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my\\nmind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw\\nher arms round him and tried to hold him back.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Fritz! Fritz!â\\x80\\x99 she cried in English, â\\x80\\x98remember your promise after the\\nlast time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh, he\\nwill be silent!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98You are mad, Elise!â\\x80\\x99 he shouted, struggling to break away from her.\\nâ\\x80\\x98You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!â\\x80\\x99\\nHe dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with\\nhis heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to\\nthe sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip\\nloosened, and I fell into the garden below.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and\\nrushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood\\nthat I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I\\nran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my\\nhand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw\\nthat my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my\\nwound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a\\nsudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among\\nthe rose-bushes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a\\nvery long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was\\nbreaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew,\\nand my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The\\nsmarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my nightâ\\x80\\x99s\\nadventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly\\nyet be safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to\\nlook round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. I had been\\nlying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad, and just a little\\nlower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it,\\nto be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night.\\nWere it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during\\nthose dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHalf dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train.\\nThere would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was\\non duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him\\nwhether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was\\nstrange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for\\nme? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was\\none about three miles off.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to\\nwait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It\\nwas a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound\\ndressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I\\nput the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this\\nextraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the\\nshelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his\\ncuttings.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere is an advertisement which will interest you,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cIt\\nappeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: â\\x80\\x98Lost, on\\nthe 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic\\nengineer. Left his lodgings at ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock at night, and has not been\\nheard of since. Was dressed in,â\\x80\\x99 etc., etc. Ha! That represents the\\nlast time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I\\nfancy.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood heavens!â\\x80\\x9d cried my patient. â\\x80\\x9cThen that explains what the girl\\nsaid.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cUndoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and\\ndesperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand\\nin the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will\\nleave no survivor from a captured ship. Well, every moment now is\\nprecious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard\\nat once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSome three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together,\\nbound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock\\nHolmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard,\\na plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map\\nof the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing\\na circle with Eyford for its centre.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere you are,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cThat circle is drawn at a radius of ten\\nmiles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that\\nline. You said ten miles, I think, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was an hourâ\\x80\\x99s good drive.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you think that they brought you back all that way when you were\\nunconscious?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been\\nlifted and conveyed somewhere.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat I cannot understand,â\\x80\\x9d said I, â\\x80\\x9cis why they should have spared you\\nwhen they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain\\nwas softened by the womanâ\\x80\\x99s entreaties.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my\\nlife.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, we shall soon clear up all that,â\\x80\\x9d said Bradstreet. â\\x80\\x9cWell, I have\\ndrawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk\\nthat we are in search of are to be found.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think I could lay my finger on it,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes quietly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cReally, now!â\\x80\\x9d cried the inspector, â\\x80\\x9cyou have formed your opinion!\\nCome, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the\\ncountry is more deserted there.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd I say east,â\\x80\\x9d said my patient.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am for west,â\\x80\\x9d remarked the plain-clothes man. â\\x80\\x9cThere are several\\nquiet little villages up there.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd I am for north,â\\x80\\x9d said I, â\\x80\\x9cbecause there are no hills there, and\\nour friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome,â\\x80\\x9d cried the inspector, laughing; â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s a very pretty diversity of\\nopinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you give your\\ncasting vote to?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are all wrong.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut we canâ\\x80\\x99t all be.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes, you can. This is my point.â\\x80\\x9d He placed his finger in the\\ncentre of the circle. â\\x80\\x9cThis is where we shall find them.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut the twelve-mile drive?â\\x80\\x9d gasped Hatherley.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSix out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse\\nwas fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had\\ngone twelve miles over heavy roads?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIndeed, it is a likely ruse enough,â\\x80\\x9d observed Bradstreet thoughtfully.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNone at all,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes. â\\x80\\x9cThey are coiners on a large scale, and\\nhave used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of\\nsilver.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\ninspector. â\\x80\\x9cThey have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We\\neven traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they\\nhad covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old\\nhands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got\\nthem right enough.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined\\nto fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we\\nsaw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small\\nclump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich\\nfeather over the landscape.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA house on fire?â\\x80\\x9d asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on\\nits way.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir!â\\x80\\x9d said the station-master.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen did it break out?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and\\nthe whole place is in a blaze.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhose house is it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDr. Becherâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTell me,â\\x80\\x9d broke in the engineer, â\\x80\\x9cis Dr. Becher a German, very thin,\\nwith a long, sharp nose?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe station-master laughed heartily. â\\x80\\x9cNo, sir, Dr. Becher is an\\nEnglishman, and there isnâ\\x80\\x99t a man in the parish who has a better-lined\\nwaistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I\\nunderstand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good\\nBerkshire beef would do him no harm.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe station-master had not finished his speech before we were all\\nhastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and\\nthere was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us,\\nspouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front\\nthree fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s it!â\\x80\\x9d cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. â\\x80\\x9cThere is the\\ngravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second\\nwindow is the one that I jumped from.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, at least,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, â\\x80\\x9cyou have had your revenge upon them.\\nThere can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was\\ncrushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt\\nthey were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time.\\nNow keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night,\\nthough I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd Holmesâ\\x80\\x99 fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no\\nword has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister\\nGerman, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met\\na cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving\\nrapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the\\nfugitives disappeared, and even Holmesâ\\x80\\x99 ingenuity failed ever to\\ndiscover the least clue as to their whereabouts.\\n\\nThe firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which\\nthey had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed\\nhuman thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset,\\nhowever, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the\\nflames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been\\nreduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and\\niron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our\\nunfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin\\nwere discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found,\\nwhich may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have\\nbeen already referred to.\\n\\nHow our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the\\nspot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a\\nmystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain\\ntale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom\\nhad remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the\\nwhole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold\\nor less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear\\nthe unconscious man out of the way of danger.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once\\nmore to London, â\\x80\\x9cit has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my\\nthumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExperience,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, laughing. â\\x80\\x9cIndirectly it may be of value,\\nyou know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of\\nbeing excellent company for the remainder of your existence.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\nX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR\\n\\nThe Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long\\nceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which\\nthe unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and\\ntheir more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this\\nfour-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the\\nfull facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my\\nfriend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter\\nup, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little\\nsketch of this remarkable episode.\\n\\nIt was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was\\nstill sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from\\nan afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. I\\nhad remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn\\nto rain, with high autumnal winds, and the jezail bullet which I had\\nbrought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign\\nthrobbed with dull persistence. With my body in one easy-chair and my\\nlegs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers\\nuntil at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all\\naside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the\\nenvelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friendâ\\x80\\x99s noble\\ncorrespondent could be.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere is a very fashionable epistle,â\\x80\\x9d I remarked as he entered. â\\x80\\x9cYour\\nmorning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a\\ntide-waiter.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,â\\x80\\x9d he\\nanswered, smiling, â\\x80\\x9cand the humbler are usually the more interesting.\\nThis looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon\\na man either to be bored or to lie.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe broke the seal and glanced over the contents.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot social, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, distinctly professional.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd from a noble client?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne of the highest in England.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear fellow, I congratulate you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my\\nclient is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case.\\nIt is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this\\nnew investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late,\\nhave you not?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt looks like it,â\\x80\\x9d said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the\\ncorner. â\\x80\\x9cI have had nothing else to do.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read\\nnothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is\\nalways instructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely\\nyou must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes, with the deepest interest.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St.\\nSimon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these\\npapers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he\\nsays:\\n\\n    â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,â\\x80\\x94Lord Backwater tells me that I may\\n    place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I have\\n    determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in\\n    reference to the very painful event which has occurred in\\n    connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is\\n    acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no\\n    objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it\\n    might be of some assistance. I will call at four oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the\\n    afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time,\\n    I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount\\n    importance. Yours faithfully,\\n\\n\\n    â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98ROBERT ST. SIMON.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the\\nnoble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer\\nside of his right little finger,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Holmes as he folded up the\\nepistle.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe says four oâ\\x80\\x99clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the\\nsubject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order\\nof time, while I take a glance as to who our client is.â\\x80\\x9d He picked a\\nred-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the\\nmantelpiece. â\\x80\\x9cHere he is,â\\x80\\x9d said he, sitting down and flattening it out\\nupon his knee. â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son\\nof the Duke of Balmoral.â\\x80\\x99 Hum! â\\x80\\x98Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief\\nover a fess sable. Born in 1846.â\\x80\\x99 Heâ\\x80\\x99s forty-one years of age, which is\\nmature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late\\nadministration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for\\nForeign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and\\nTudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive\\nin all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something more\\nsolid.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have very little difficulty in finding what I want,â\\x80\\x9d said I, â\\x80\\x9cfor\\nthe facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I\\nfeared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry\\non hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van.\\nThat is quite cleared up nowâ\\x80\\x94though, indeed, it was obvious from the\\nfirst. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal\\ncolumn of the _Morning Post_, and dates, as you see, some weeks back:\\nâ\\x80\\x98A marriage has been arranged,â\\x80\\x99 it says, â\\x80\\x98and will, if rumour is\\ncorrect, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second\\nson of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of\\nAloysius Doran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.â\\x80\\x99 That is all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTerse and to the point,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin\\nlegs towards the fire.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of\\nthe same week. Ah, here it is: â\\x80\\x98There will soon be a call for\\nprotection in the marriage  market, for the present free-trade\\nprinciple appears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one\\nthe management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the\\nhands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important\\naddition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes\\nwhich have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon,\\nwho has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little\\ngodâ\\x80\\x99s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage\\nwith Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California\\nmillionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face\\nattracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only\\nchild, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to\\nconsiderably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. As\\nit is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to\\nsell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon has\\nno property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is\\nobvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an\\nalliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition\\nfrom a Republican lady to a British peeress.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnything else?â\\x80\\x9d asked Holmes, yawning.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the _Morning Post_ to\\nsay that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would\\nbe at St. Georgeâ\\x80\\x99s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate\\nfriends would be invited, and that the party would return to the\\nfurnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius\\nDoran. Two days laterâ\\x80\\x94that is, on Wednesday lastâ\\x80\\x94there is a curt\\nannouncement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon\\nwould be passed at Lord Backwaterâ\\x80\\x99s place, near Petersfield. Those are\\nall the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBefore the what?â\\x80\\x9d asked Holmes with a start.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe vanishing of the lady.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen did she vanish, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt the wedding breakfast.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIndeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite\\ndramatic, in fact.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the\\nhoneymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this.\\nPray let me have the details.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI warn you that they are very incomplete.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps we may make them less so.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSuch as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning\\npaper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, â\\x80\\x98Singular\\nOccurrence at a Fashionable Weddingâ\\x80\\x99:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest\\nconsternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken\\nplace in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly\\nannounced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning;\\nbut it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange\\nrumours which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of the\\nattempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention\\nhas now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by\\naffecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98The ceremony, which was performed at St. Georgeâ\\x80\\x99s, Hanover Square,\\nwas a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the\\nbride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater,\\nLord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister\\nof the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party\\nproceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster\\nGate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little\\ntrouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who\\nendeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party,\\nalleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after\\na painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and\\nthe footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before\\nthis unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest,\\nwhen she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room.\\nHer prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed\\nher, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber\\nfor an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the\\npassage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the\\nhouse thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his\\nmistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that\\nhis daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with\\nthe bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the\\npolice, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will\\nprobably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business.\\nUp to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the\\nwhereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the\\nmatter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the\\nwoman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from\\njealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the\\nstrange disappearance of the bride.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd is that all?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOnly one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a\\nsuggestive one.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd it isâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has\\nactually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a _danseuse_\\nat the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years.\\nThere are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands\\nnowâ\\x80\\x94so far as it has been set forth in the public press.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have\\nmissed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as\\nthe clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this\\nwill prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I\\nvery much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own\\nmemory.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLord Robert St. Simon,â\\x80\\x9d announced our page-boy, throwing open the\\ndoor. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed\\nand pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with\\nthe steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever\\nbeen to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his\\ngeneral appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight\\nforward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair,\\ntoo, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the\\nedges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the\\nverge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white\\nwaistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured\\ngaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left\\nto right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden\\neyeglasses.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood-day, Lord St. Simon,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, rising and bowing. â\\x80\\x9cPray take\\nthe basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up\\na little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr.\\nHolmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have\\nalready managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I\\npresume that they were hardly from the same class of society.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I am descending.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI beg pardon.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy last client of the sort was a king.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, really! I had no idea. And which king?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe King of Scandinavia.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat! Had he lost his wife?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou can understand,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes suavely, â\\x80\\x9cthat I extend to the\\naffairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in\\nyours.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course! Very right! very right! Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure I beg pardon. As to my own\\ncase, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in\\nforming an opinion.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints,\\nnothing more. I presume that I may take it as correctâ\\x80\\x94this article, for\\nexample, as to the disappearance of the bride.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLord St. Simon glanced over it. â\\x80\\x9cYes, it is correct, as far as it\\ngoes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer\\nan opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by\\nquestioning you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPray do so.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn San Francisco, a year ago.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou were travelling in the States?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you become engaged then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you were on a friendly footing?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHer father is very rich?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd how did he make his money?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold,\\ninvested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, what is your own impression as to the young ladyâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x94your wifeâ\\x80\\x99s\\ncharacter?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the\\nfire. â\\x80\\x9cYou see, Mr. Holmes,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cmy wife was twenty before her\\nfather became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining\\ncamp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has\\ncome from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call\\nin England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by\\nany sort of traditions. She is impetuousâ\\x80\\x94volcanic, I was about to say.\\nShe is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her\\nresolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name\\nwhich I have the honour to bearâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94he gave a little stately coughâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9chad I\\nnot thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is\\ncapable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would\\nbe repugnant to her.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave you her photograph?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI brought this with me.â\\x80\\x9d He opened a locket and showed us the full\\nface of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory\\nminiature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the\\nlustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth.\\nHolmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and\\nhanded it back to Lord St. Simon.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your\\nacquaintance?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met\\nher several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a _fait\\naccompli_?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI really have made no inquiries on the subject.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the\\nwedding?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWas she in good spirits?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future\\nlives.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIndeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe was as bright as possibleâ\\x80\\x94at least until after the ceremony.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd did you observe any change in her then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever\\nseen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was\\ntoo trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPray let us have it, for all that.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the\\nvestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over\\ninto the pew. There was a momentâ\\x80\\x99s delay, but the gentleman in the pew\\nhanded it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for\\nthe fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me\\nabruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly\\nagitated over this trifling cause.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIndeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the\\ngeneral public were present, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis gentleman was not one of your wifeâ\\x80\\x99s friends?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a\\ncommon-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I\\nthink that we are wandering rather far from the point.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful\\nframe of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering\\nher fatherâ\\x80\\x99s house?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI saw her in conversation with her maid.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd who is her maid?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAlice is her name. She is an American and came from California with\\nher.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA confidential servant?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to\\ntake great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these\\nthings in a different way.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow long did she speak to this Alice?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou did not overhear what they said?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLady St. Simon said something about â\\x80\\x98jumping a claim.â\\x80\\x99 She was\\naccustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAmerican slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do\\nwhen she finished speaking to her maid?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe walked into the breakfast-room.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn your arm?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then,\\nafter we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly,\\nmuttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came\\nback.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her\\nroom, covered her brideâ\\x80\\x99s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet,\\nand went out.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in\\ncompany with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had\\nalready made a disturbance at Mr. Doranâ\\x80\\x99s house that morning.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and\\nyour relations to her.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. â\\x80\\x9cWe have\\nbeen on a friendly footing for some yearsâ\\x80\\x94I may say on a _very_\\nfriendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her\\nungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but\\nyou know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but\\nexceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me\\ndreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to\\ntell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly\\nwas that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came\\nto Mr. Doranâ\\x80\\x99s door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push\\nher way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even\\nthreatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the\\nsort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon\\npushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good\\nin making a row.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid your wife hear all this?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, thank goodness, she did not.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so\\nserious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some\\nterrible trap for her.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, it is a possible supposition.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou think so, too?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this\\nas likely?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do not think Flora would hurt a fly.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStill, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is\\nyour own theory as to what took place?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have\\ngiven you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it\\nhas occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the\\nconsciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the\\neffect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn short, that she had become suddenly deranged?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, really, when I consider that she has turned her backâ\\x80\\x94I will not\\nsay upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without\\nsuccessâ\\x80\\x94I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes,\\nsmiling. â\\x80\\x9cAnd now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my\\ndata. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that\\nyou could see out of the window?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe could see the other side of the road and the Park.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I\\nshall communicate with you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShould you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,â\\x80\\x9d said our\\nclient, rising.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have solved it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEh? What was that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI say that I have solved it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere, then, is my wife?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is a detail which I shall speedily supply.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLord St. Simon shook his head. â\\x80\\x9cI am afraid that it will take wiser\\nheads than yours or mine,â\\x80\\x9d he remarked, and bowing in a stately,\\nold-fashioned manner he departed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a\\nlevel with his own,â\\x80\\x9d said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. â\\x80\\x9cI think that I\\nshall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this\\ncross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case before\\nour client came into the room.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear Holmes!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked\\nbefore, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to turn\\nmy conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally\\nvery convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote\\nThoreauâ\\x80\\x99s example.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I have heard all that you have heard.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWithout, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me\\nso well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and\\nsomething on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the\\nFranco-Prussian War. It is one of these casesâ\\x80\\x94but, hullo, here is\\nLestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon\\nthe sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which\\ngave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas\\nbag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the\\ncigar which had been offered to him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s up, then?â\\x80\\x9d asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. â\\x80\\x9cYou look\\ndissatisfied.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case.\\nI can make neither head nor tail of the business.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cReally! You surprise me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip\\nthrough my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd very wet it seems to have made you,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes laying his hand\\nupon the arm of the pea-jacket.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn Heavenâ\\x80\\x99s name, what for?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn search of the body of Lady St. Simon.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?â\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy? What do you mean?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one\\nas in the other.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. â\\x80\\x9cI suppose you know all\\nabout it,â\\x80\\x9d he snarled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the\\nmatter?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think it very unlikely.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in\\nit?â\\x80\\x9d He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a\\nwedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a\\nbrideâ\\x80\\x99s wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. â\\x80\\x9cThere,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. â\\x80\\x9cThere is\\na little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, indeed!â\\x80\\x9d said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. â\\x80\\x9cYou\\ndragged them from the Serpentine?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They\\nhave been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the\\nclothes were there the body would not be far off.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBy the same brilliant reasoning, every manâ\\x80\\x99s body is to be found in\\nthe neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive\\nat through this?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am afraid that you will find it difficult.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you, indeed, now?â\\x80\\x9d cried Lestrade with some bitterness. â\\x80\\x9cI am\\nafraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions\\nand your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes.\\nThis dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd how?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the\\ncard-case is a note. And here is the very note.â\\x80\\x9d He slapped it down\\nupon the table in front of him. â\\x80\\x9cListen to this: â\\x80\\x98You will see me when\\nall is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.â\\x80\\x99 Now my theory all along has been\\nthat Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she,\\nwith confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance.\\nHere, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt\\nquietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within\\ntheir reach.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery good, Lestrade,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, laughing. â\\x80\\x9cYou really are very fine\\nindeed. Let me see it.â\\x80\\x9d He took up the paper in a listless way, but his\\nattention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of\\nsatisfaction. â\\x80\\x9cThis is indeed important,â\\x80\\x9d said he.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHa! you find it so?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExtremely so. I congratulate you warmly.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. â\\x80\\x9cWhy,â\\x80\\x9d he\\nshrieked, â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99re looking at the wrong side!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn the contrary, this is the right side.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe right side? Youâ\\x80\\x99re mad! Here is the note written in pencil over\\nhere.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill,\\nwhich interests me deeply.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing in it. I looked at it before,â\\x80\\x9d said Lestrade. â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Oct.\\n4th, rooms 8_s_., breakfast 2_s_. 6_d_., cocktail 1_s_., lunch 2_s_.\\n6_d_., glass sherry, 8_d_.â\\x80\\x99 I see nothing in that.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note,\\nit is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate\\nyou again.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve wasted time enough,â\\x80\\x9d said Lestrade, rising. â\\x80\\x9cI believe in hard\\nwork and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day,\\nMr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter\\nfirst.â\\x80\\x9d He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made\\nfor the door.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust one hint to you, Lestrade,â\\x80\\x9d drawled Holmes before his rival\\nvanished; â\\x80\\x9cI will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St.\\nSimon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such\\nperson.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his\\nforehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.\\n\\nHe had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his\\novercoat. â\\x80\\x9cThere is something in what the fellow says about outdoor\\nwork,â\\x80\\x9d he remarked, â\\x80\\x9cso I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your\\npapers for a little.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was after five oâ\\x80\\x99clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no\\ntime to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectionerâ\\x80\\x99s\\nman with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a\\nyouth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great\\nastonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out\\nupon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of\\ncold woodcock, a pheasant, a _pÃ¢tÃ© de foie gras_ pie with a group of\\nancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my\\ntwo visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with\\nno explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered\\nto this address.\\n\\nJust before nine oâ\\x80\\x99clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room.\\nHis features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which\\nmade me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey have laid the supper, then,â\\x80\\x9d he said, rubbing his hands.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou seem to expect company. They have laid for five.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cI am\\nsurprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that\\nI hear his step now upon the stairs.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in,\\ndangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very\\nperturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy messenger reached you, then?â\\x80\\x9d asked Holmes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have\\nyou good authority for what you say?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe best possible.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat will the Duke say,â\\x80\\x9d he murmured, â\\x80\\x9cwhen he hears that one of the\\nfamily has been subjected to such humiliation?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any\\nhumiliation.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, you look on these things from another standpoint.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady\\ncould have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was\\nundoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise\\nher at such a crisis.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was a slight, sir, a public slight,â\\x80\\x9d said Lord St. Simon, tapping\\nhis fingers upon the table.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented\\na position.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been\\nshamefully used.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think that I heard a ring,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes. â\\x80\\x9cYes, there are steps on\\nthe landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the\\nmatter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more\\nsuccessful.â\\x80\\x9d He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLord St. Simon,â\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9callow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs.\\nFrancis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAt the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and\\nstood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the\\nbreast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had\\ntaken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he\\nstill refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution,\\nperhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re angry, Robert,â\\x80\\x9d said she. â\\x80\\x9cWell, I guess you have every cause\\nto be.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPray make no apology to me,â\\x80\\x9d said Lord St. Simon bitterly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should\\nhave spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from\\nthe time when I saw Frank here again I just didnâ\\x80\\x99t know what I was\\ndoing or saying. I only wonder I didnâ\\x80\\x99t fall down and do a faint right\\nthere before the altar.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the\\nroom while you explain this matter?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf I may give an opinion,â\\x80\\x9d remarked the strange gentleman, â\\x80\\x9cweâ\\x80\\x99ve had\\njust a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part,\\nI should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.â\\x80\\x9d He was\\na small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert\\nmanner.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell our story right away,â\\x80\\x9d said the lady. â\\x80\\x9cFrank here and I\\nmet in â\\x80\\x9984, in McQuireâ\\x80\\x99s camp, near the Rockies, where Pa was working a\\nclaim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day\\nfather struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had\\na claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer Pa grew the\\npoorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t hear of our engagement lasting\\nany longer, and he took me away to â\\x80\\x99Frisco. Frank wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t throw up his\\nhand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing\\nanything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just\\nfixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his\\npile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa.\\nSo then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged\\nmyself not to marry anyone else while he lived. â\\x80\\x98Why shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t we be\\nmarried right away, then,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98and then I will feel sure of you;\\nand I wonâ\\x80\\x99t claim to be your husband until I come back?â\\x80\\x99 Well, we\\ntalked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman\\nall ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank\\nwent off to seek his fortune, and I went back to Pa.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went\\nprospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After\\nthat came a long newspaper story about how a minersâ\\x80\\x99 camp had been\\nattacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frankâ\\x80\\x99s name among the\\nkilled. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa\\nthought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in â\\x80\\x99Frisco. Not\\na word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that\\nFrank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to â\\x80\\x99Frisco, and we came\\nto London, and a marriage was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I\\nfelt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place\\nin my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStill, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course Iâ\\x80\\x99d have done my\\nduty by him. We canâ\\x80\\x99t command our love, but we can our actions. I went\\nto the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a\\nwife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just\\nas I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and\\nlooking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at\\nfirst; but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of\\nquestion in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to\\nsee him. I wonder I didnâ\\x80\\x99t drop. I know that everything was turning\\nround, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee\\nin my ear. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make\\na scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know\\nwhat I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to\\nbe still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that\\nhe was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped\\nmy bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he\\nreturned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when\\nhe made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment\\nthat my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever\\nhe might direct.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and\\nhad always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a\\nfew things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to\\nLord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all\\nthose great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain\\nafterwards. I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank\\nout of the window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me and\\nthen began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and\\nfollowed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St.\\nSimon to meâ\\x80\\x94seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little\\nsecret of his own before marriage alsoâ\\x80\\x94but I managed to get away from\\nher and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we\\ndrove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my\\ntrue wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a\\nprisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to â\\x80\\x99Frisco, found that\\nI had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there,\\nand had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI saw it in a paper,â\\x80\\x9d explained the American. â\\x80\\x9cIt gave the name and\\nthe church but not where the lady lived.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for\\nopenness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should\\nlike to vanish away and never see any of them againâ\\x80\\x94just sending a line\\nto Pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to\\nthink of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table\\nand waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and\\nthings and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and\\ndropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely\\nthat we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good\\ngentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he\\nfound us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and\\nkindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be\\nputting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to\\ngive us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came\\nright away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it\\nall, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you\\ndo not think very meanly of me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had\\nlistened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long\\nnarrative.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcuse me,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cbut it is not my custom to discuss my most\\nintimate personal affairs in this public manner.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you wonâ\\x80\\x99t forgive me? You wonâ\\x80\\x99t shake hands before I go?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.â\\x80\\x9d He put out his hand\\nand coldly grasped that which she extended to him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI had hoped,â\\x80\\x9d suggested Holmes, â\\x80\\x9cthat you would have joined us in a\\nfriendly supper.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think that there you ask a little too much,â\\x80\\x9d responded his Lordship.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can\\nhardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that with your\\npermission I will now wish you all a very good-night.â\\x80\\x9d He included us\\nall in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen I trust that you at least will honour me with your company,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nSherlock Holmes. â\\x80\\x9cIt is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton,\\nfor I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the\\nblundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our\\nchildren from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country\\nunder a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the\\nStars and Stripes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe case has been an interesting one,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Holmes when our\\nvisitors had left us, â\\x80\\x9cbecause it serves to show very clearly how\\nsimple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems\\nto be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the\\nsequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than\\nthe result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland\\nYard.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou were not yourself at fault at all, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFrom the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the\\nlady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other\\nthat she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home.\\nObviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her\\nto change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have\\nspoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of\\nthe bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be\\nsomeone from America because she had spent so short a time in this\\ncountry that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an\\ninfluence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to\\nchange her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a\\nprocess of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American.\\nThen who could this American be, and why should he possess so much\\ninfluence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her\\nyoung womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under\\nstrange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St.\\nSimonâ\\x80\\x99s narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in\\nthe brideâ\\x80\\x99s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as\\nthe dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and\\nof her very significant allusion to claim-jumpingâ\\x80\\x94which in minersâ\\x80\\x99\\nparlance means taking possession of that which another person has a\\nprior claim toâ\\x80\\x94the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had\\ngone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous\\nhusbandâ\\x80\\x94the chances being in favour of the latter.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd how in the world did you find them?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in\\nhis hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials\\nwere, of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was\\nit to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the\\nmost select London hotels.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow did you deduce the select?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBy the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a\\nglass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are\\nnot many in London which charge at that rate. In the second one which I\\nvisited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the\\nbook that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the\\nday before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon\\nthe very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were\\nto be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being\\nfortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give\\nthem some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be\\nbetter in every way that they should make their position a little\\nclearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular.\\nI invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the\\nappointment.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut with no very good result,â\\x80\\x9d I remarked. â\\x80\\x9cHis conduct was certainly\\nnot very gracious.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, Watson,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, smiling, â\\x80\\x9cperhaps you would not be very\\ngracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you\\nfound yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think\\nthat we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars\\nthat we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw\\nyour chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still\\nto solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\nXI. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHolmes,â\\x80\\x9d said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down\\nthe street, â\\x80\\x9chere is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that\\nhis relatives should allow him to come out alone.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMy friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the\\npockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a\\nbright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still\\nlay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down\\nthe centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly\\nband by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of\\nthe footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell. The grey pavement\\nhad been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so\\nthat there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction\\nof the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman\\nwhose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.\\n\\nHe was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a\\nmassive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed\\nin a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat\\nbrown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were\\nin absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was\\nrunning hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives\\nwho is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he\\njerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face\\ninto the most extraordinary contortions.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat on earth can be the matter with him?â\\x80\\x9d I asked. â\\x80\\x9cHe is looking up\\nat the numbers of the houses.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI believe that he is coming here,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, rubbing his hands.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think\\nthat I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?â\\x80\\x9d As he spoke,\\nthe man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell\\nuntil the whole house resounded with the clanging.\\n\\nA few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still\\ngesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his\\neyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For\\na while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked\\nat his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his\\nreason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against\\nthe wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away\\nto the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the\\neasy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with\\nhim in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have come to me to tell your story, have you not?â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cYou\\nare fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered\\nyourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little\\nproblem which you may submit to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against\\nhis emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his\\nlips tight, and turned his face towards us.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo doubt you think me mad?â\\x80\\x9d said he.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see that you have had some great trouble,â\\x80\\x9d responded Holmes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGod knows I have!â\\x80\\x94a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so\\nsudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced,\\nalthough I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain.\\nPrivate affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming\\ntogether, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very\\nsoul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may\\nsuffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPray compose yourself, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, â\\x80\\x9cand let me have a clear\\naccount of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy name,â\\x80\\x9d answered our visitor, â\\x80\\x9cis probably familiar to your ears. I\\nam Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of\\nThreadneedle Street.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner\\nin the second largest private banking concern in the City of London.\\nWhat could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens\\nof London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until\\nwith another effort he braced himself to tell his story.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI feel that time is of value,â\\x80\\x9d said he; â\\x80\\x9cthat is why I hastened here\\nwhen the police inspector suggested that I should secure your\\nco-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried\\nfrom there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is\\nwhy I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little\\nexercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as\\nshortly and yet as clearly as I can.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking\\nbusiness as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative\\ninvestments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the\\nnumber of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out\\nmoney is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We\\nhave done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and\\nthere are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon\\nthe security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card\\nwas brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the\\nname, for it was that of none other thanâ\\x80\\x94well, perhaps even to you I\\nhad better say no more than that it was a name which is a household\\nword all over the earthâ\\x80\\x94one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names\\nin England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he\\nentered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air\\nof a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Mr. Holder,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98I have been informed that you are in the habit\\nof advancing money.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98The firm does so when the security is good.â\\x80\\x99 I answered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98It is absolutely essential to me,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98that I should have Â£\\n50,000 at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times\\nover from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business\\nand to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily\\nunderstand that it is unwise to place oneâ\\x80\\x99s self under obligations.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?â\\x80\\x99 I asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most\\ncertainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it\\nright to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should\\nbe paid at once.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own\\nprivate purse,â\\x80\\x99 said I, â\\x80\\x98were it not that the strain would be rather\\nmore than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the\\nname of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that,\\neven in your case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I should much prefer to have it so,â\\x80\\x99 said he, raising up a square,\\nblack morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. â\\x80\\x98You have\\ndoubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,â\\x80\\x99 said I.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Precisely.â\\x80\\x99 He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft,\\nflesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he\\nhad named. â\\x80\\x98There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98and the\\nprice of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would\\nput the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am\\nprepared to leave it with you as my security.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity\\nfrom it to my illustrious client.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98You doubt its value?â\\x80\\x99 he asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Not at all. I only doubtâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about\\nthat. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain\\nthat I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter\\nof form. Is the security sufficient?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Ample.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of\\nthe confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard\\nof you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all\\ngossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with\\nevery possible precaution because I need not say that a great public\\nscandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it\\nwould be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no\\nberyls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to\\nreplace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and\\nI shall call for it in person on Monday morning.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSeeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but,\\ncalling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty Â£ 1000 notes.\\nWhen I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon\\nthe table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of\\nthe immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no\\ndoubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would\\nensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having\\never consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter\\nthe matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once\\nmore to my work.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so\\nprecious a thing in the office behind me. Bankersâ\\x80\\x99 safes had been\\nforced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible\\nwould be the position in which I should find myself! I determined,\\ntherefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case\\nbackward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of\\nmy reach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house\\nat Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely\\nuntil I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my\\ndressing-room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to\\nthoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of\\nthe house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants\\nwho have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability\\nis quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid,\\nhas only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent\\ncharacter, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very\\npretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about\\nthe place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we\\nbelieve her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will\\nnot take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son,\\nArthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmesâ\\x80\\x94a grievous\\ndisappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell\\nme that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died\\nI felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile\\nfade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish.\\nPerhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner,\\nbut I meant it for the best.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my\\nbusiness, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and,\\nto speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums\\nof money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club,\\nand there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a\\nnumber of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play\\nheavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again\\nand again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his\\nallowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than\\nonce to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but\\neach time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough\\nto draw him back again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell\\nshould gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to\\nmy house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the\\nfascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world\\nto his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a\\nbrilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think\\nof him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am\\nconvinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in\\nhis eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think,\\nand so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a womanâ\\x80\\x99s quick insight\\ninto character.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when\\nmy brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I\\nadopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is\\na sunbeam in my houseâ\\x80\\x94sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and\\nhousekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be.\\nShe is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In\\nonly one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has\\nasked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she\\nhas refused him. I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the\\nright path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have\\nchanged his whole life; but now, alas! it is too lateâ\\x80\\x94forever too late!\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I\\nshall continue with my miserable story.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after\\ndinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious\\ntreasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my\\nclient. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left\\nthe room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur\\nwere much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I\\nthought it better not to disturb it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Where have you put it?â\\x80\\x99 asked Arthur.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98In my own bureau.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Well, I hope to goodness the house wonâ\\x80\\x99t be burgled during the\\nnight.â\\x80\\x99 said he.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98It is locked up,â\\x80\\x99 I answered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have\\nopened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what\\nhe said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very\\ngrave face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Look here, dad,â\\x80\\x99 said he with his eyes cast down, â\\x80\\x98can you let me\\nhave Â£ 200?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98No, I cannot!â\\x80\\x99 I answered sharply. â\\x80\\x98I have been far too generous with\\nyou in money matters.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98You have been very kind,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98but I must have this money, or\\nelse I can never show my face inside the club again.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98And a very good thing, too!â\\x80\\x99 I cried.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,â\\x80\\x99 said he.\\nâ\\x80\\x98I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and\\nif you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. â\\x80\\x98You\\nshall not have a farthing from me,â\\x80\\x99 I cried, on which he bowed and left\\nthe room without another word.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was\\nsafe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see\\nthat all was secureâ\\x80\\x94a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I\\nthought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs\\nI saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and\\nfastened as I approached.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Tell me, dad,â\\x80\\x99 said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, â\\x80\\x98did\\nyou give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Certainly not.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has\\nonly been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is\\nhardly safe and should be stopped.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are\\nyou sure that everything is fastened?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Quite sure, dad.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Then, good-night.â\\x80\\x99 I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again,\\nwhere I was soon asleep.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have\\nany bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any\\npoint which I do not make clear.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be\\nparticularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my\\nmind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in\\nthe morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had\\nceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as\\nthough a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all\\nmy ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of\\nfootsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all\\npalpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room\\ndoor.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Arthur!â\\x80\\x99 I screamed, â\\x80\\x98you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that\\ncoronet?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed\\nonly in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding\\nthe coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending\\nit with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and\\nturned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the\\ngold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98You blackguard!â\\x80\\x99 I shouted, beside myself with rage. â\\x80\\x98You have\\ndestroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the jewels\\nwhich you have stolen?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Stolen!â\\x80\\x99 he cried.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Yes, thief!â\\x80\\x99 I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,â\\x80\\x99 said he.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you\\na liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another\\npiece?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98You have called me names enough,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98I will not stand it any\\nlonger. I shall not say another word about this business, since you\\nhave chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and\\nmake my own way in the world.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98You shall leave it in the hands of the police!â\\x80\\x99 I cried half-mad with\\ngrief and rage. â\\x80\\x98I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98You shall learn nothing from me,â\\x80\\x99 said he with a passion such as I\\nshould not have thought was in his nature. â\\x80\\x98If you choose to call the\\npolice, let the police find what they can.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBy this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in\\nmy anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of\\nthe coronet and of Arthurâ\\x80\\x99s face, she read the whole story and, with a\\nscream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the housemaid for the\\npolice and put the investigation into their hands at once. When the\\ninspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood\\nsullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to\\ncharge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private\\nmatter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was\\nnational property. I was determined that the law should have its way in\\neverything.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98At least,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98you will not have me arrested at once. It would\\nbe to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for\\nfive minutes.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have\\nstolen,â\\x80\\x99 said I. And then, realising the dreadful position in which I\\nwas placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that\\nof one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened\\nto raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it\\nall if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing\\nstones.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98You may as well face the matter,â\\x80\\x99 said I; â\\x80\\x98you have been caught in\\nthe act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you\\nbut make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the\\nberyls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,â\\x80\\x99 he answered, turning\\naway from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any words\\nof mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in the\\ninspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only\\nof his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where\\nhe could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could\\nbe found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our\\npersuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and\\nI, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round\\nto you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The\\npolice have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of\\nit. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have already\\noffered a reward of Â£ 1000. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my\\nhonour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro,\\ndroning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted\\nand his eyes fixed upon the fire.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you receive much company?â\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNone save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of\\nArthurâ\\x80\\x99s. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one\\nelse, I think.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you go out much in society?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cArthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is unusual in a young girl.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is\\nfour-and-twenty.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her\\nalso.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTerrible! She is even more affected than I.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have neither of you any doubt as to your sonâ\\x80\\x99s guilt?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in\\nhis hands.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the\\ncoronet at all injured?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, it was twisted.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten\\nit?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGod bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it\\nis too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose\\nwere innocent, why did he not say so?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrecisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His\\nsilence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular\\npoints about the case. What did the police think of the noise which\\nawoke you from your sleep?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey considered that it might be caused by Arthurâ\\x80\\x99s closing his\\nbedroom door.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as\\nto wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of\\nthese gems?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the\\nhope of finding them.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave they thought of looking outside the house?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has\\nalready been minutely examined.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, my dear sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, â\\x80\\x9cis it not obvious to you now that\\nthis matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the\\npolice were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a\\nsimple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is\\ninvolved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his\\nbed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau,\\ntook out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it,\\nwent off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the\\nthirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then\\nreturned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed\\nhimself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is\\nsuch a theory tenable?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what other is there?â\\x80\\x9d cried the banker with a gesture of despair.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is our task to find that out,â\\x80\\x9d replied Holmes; â\\x80\\x9cso now, if you\\nplease, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote\\nan hour to glancing a little more closely into details.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMy friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which\\nI was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply\\nstirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt\\nof the bankerâ\\x80\\x99s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his\\nunhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmesâ\\x80\\x99 judgment that I\\nfelt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was\\ndissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the\\nwhole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his\\nbreast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought.\\nOur client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of\\nhope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a\\ndesultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway\\njourney and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence\\nof the great financier.\\n\\nFairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a\\nlittle from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn,\\nstretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the\\nentrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into\\na narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the\\nkitchen door, and forming the tradesmenâ\\x80\\x99s entrance. On the left ran a\\nlane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at\\nall, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us\\nstanding at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the\\nfront, down the tradesmenâ\\x80\\x99s path, and so round by the garden behind\\ninto the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into\\nthe dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were\\nsitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in.\\nShe was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes,\\nwhich seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do\\nnot think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a womanâ\\x80\\x99s face.\\nHer lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying.\\nAs she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater\\nsense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the\\nmore striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character,\\nwith immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she\\nwent straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a\\nsweet womanly caress.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not,\\ndad?â\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what womanâ\\x80\\x99s instincts\\nare. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for\\nhaving acted so harshly.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy is he silent, then, if he is innocent?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect\\nhim.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the\\ncoronet in his hand?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my\\nword for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more.\\nIt is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI shall never let it drop until the gems are foundâ\\x80\\x94never, Mary! Your\\naffection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far\\nfrom hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London\\nto inquire more deeply into it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis gentleman?â\\x80\\x9d she asked, facing round to me.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the\\nstable lane now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe stable lane?â\\x80\\x9d She raised her dark eyebrows. â\\x80\\x9cWhat can he hope to\\nfind there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will\\nsucceed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin\\nArthur is innocent of this crime.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove\\nit,â\\x80\\x9d returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his\\nshoes. â\\x80\\x9cI believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder.\\nMight I ask you a question or two?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou heard nothing yourself last night?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and\\nI came down.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all\\nthe windows?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWere they all fastened this morning?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to\\nyour uncle last night that she had been out to see him?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may\\nhave heard uncleâ\\x80\\x99s remarks about the coronet.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart,\\nand that the two may have planned the robbery.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what is the good of all these vague theories,â\\x80\\x9d cried the banker\\nimpatiently, â\\x80\\x9cwhen I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet\\nin his hands?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl,\\nMiss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met\\nher slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you know him?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes! he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round. His\\nname is Francis Prosper.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe stood,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, â\\x80\\x9cto the left of the doorâ\\x80\\x94that is to say,\\nfarther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, he did.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd he is a man with a wooden leg?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSomething like fear sprang up in the young ladyâ\\x80\\x99s expressive black\\neyes. â\\x80\\x9cWhy, you are like a magician,â\\x80\\x9d said she. â\\x80\\x9cHow do you know that?â\\x80\\x9d\\nShe smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmesâ\\x80\\x99 thin, eager\\nface.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should be very glad now to go upstairs,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cI shall probably\\nwish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better\\ntake a look at the lower windows before I go up.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the\\nlarge one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he\\nopened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his\\npowerful magnifying lens. â\\x80\\x9cNow we shall go upstairs,â\\x80\\x9d said he at last.\\n\\nThe bankerâ\\x80\\x99s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with\\na grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the\\nbureau first and looked hard at the lock.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhich key was used to open it?â\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat which my son himself indicatedâ\\x80\\x94that of the cupboard of the\\nlumber-room.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave you it here?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is it on the dressing-table.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is a noiseless lock,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cIt is no wonder that it did not\\nwake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a\\nlook at it.â\\x80\\x9d He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it\\nupon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jewellerâ\\x80\\x99s art,\\nand the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one\\nside of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three\\ngems had been torn away.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, Mr. Holder,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, â\\x80\\x9chere is the corner which corresponds\\nto that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will\\nbreak it off.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe banker recoiled in horror. â\\x80\\x9cI should not dream of trying,â\\x80\\x9d said he.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen I will.â\\x80\\x9d Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without\\nresult. â\\x80\\x9cI feel it give a little,â\\x80\\x9d said he; â\\x80\\x9cbut, though I am\\nexceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to\\nbreak it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would\\nhappen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a\\npistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards\\nof your bed and that you heard nothing of it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss\\nHolder?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI confess that I still share my uncleâ\\x80\\x99s perplexity.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck\\nduring this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not\\nsucceed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I\\nshall now continue my investigations outside.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any\\nunnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour\\nor more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow\\nand his features as inscrutable as ever.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid he; â\\x80\\x9cI can serve you best by returning to my rooms.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI cannot tell.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe banker wrung his hands. â\\x80\\x9cI shall never see them again!â\\x80\\x9d he cried.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd my son? You give me hopes?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy opinion is in no way altered.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen, for Godâ\\x80\\x99s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in\\nmy house last night?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning\\nbetween nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it\\nclearer. I understand that you give me _carte blanche_ to act for you,\\nprovided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on\\nthe sum I may draw.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI would give my fortune to have them back.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery good. I shall look into the matter between this and then.\\nGood-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again\\nbefore evening.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was obvious to me that my companionâ\\x80\\x99s mind was now made up about the\\ncase, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even\\ndimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured\\nto sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other\\ntopic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three\\nwhen we found ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his\\nchamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer.\\nWith his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and\\nhis worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think that this should do,â\\x80\\x9d said he, glancing into the glass above\\nthe fireplace. â\\x80\\x9cI only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I\\nfear that it wonâ\\x80\\x99t do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may\\nbe following a will-oâ\\x80\\x99-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I\\nhope that I may be back in a few hours.â\\x80\\x9d He cut a slice of beef from\\nthe joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of\\nbread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon\\nhis expedition.\\n\\nI had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent\\nspirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it\\ndown into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI only looked in as I passed,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cI am going right on.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere to?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I\\nget back. Donâ\\x80\\x99t wait up for me in case I should be late.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow are you getting on?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since\\nI saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet\\nlittle problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal.\\nHowever, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable\\nclothes off and return to my highly respectable self.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction\\nthan his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even\\na touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a\\nfew minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that\\nhe was off once more upon his congenial hunt.\\n\\nI waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I\\nretired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for\\ndays and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his\\nlateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in,\\nbut when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a\\ncup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim\\nas possible.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cbut you\\nremember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, it is after nine now,â\\x80\\x9d I answered. â\\x80\\x9cI should not be surprised if\\nthat were he. I thought I heard a ring.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change\\nwhich had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad\\nand massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed\\nto me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy\\nwhich was even more painful than his violence of the morning before,\\nand he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for\\nhim.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,â\\x80\\x9d said he.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOnly two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in\\nthe world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow\\ncomes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted\\nme.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDeserted you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty,\\nand a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last\\nnight, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all\\nmight have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say\\nso. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:\\n\\n    â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98MY DEAREST UNCLE,â\\x80\\x94I feel that I have brought trouble upon you,\\n    and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might\\n    never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever\\n    again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you\\n    forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for;\\n    and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless\\n    labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever\\n    your loving,\\n\\n\\n    â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98MARY.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points\\nto suicide?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution.\\nI trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHa! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned\\nsomething! Where are the gems?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou would not think Â£ 1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI would pay ten.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And\\nthere is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your cheque-book? Here is a\\npen. Better make it out for Â£ 4000.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWith a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked\\nover to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three\\ngems in it, and threw it down upon the table.\\n\\nWith a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have it!â\\x80\\x9d he gasped. â\\x80\\x9cI am saved! I am saved!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he\\nhugged his recovered gems to his bosom.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,â\\x80\\x9d said Sherlock Holmes\\nrather sternly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOwe!â\\x80\\x9d He caught up a pen. â\\x80\\x9cName the sum, and I will pay it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble\\nlad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be\\nproud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen it was not Arthur who took them?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know\\nthat the truth is known.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview\\nwith him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to\\nhim, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very\\nfew details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this\\nmorning, however, may open his lips.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor Heavenâ\\x80\\x99s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And\\nlet me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and\\nfor you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George\\nBurnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy Mary? Impossible!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor\\nyour son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into\\nyour family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in Englandâ\\x80\\x94a\\nruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or\\nconscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his\\nvows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered\\nherself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what\\nhe said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of\\nseeing him nearly every evening.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI cannot, and I will not, believe it!â\\x80\\x9d cried the banker with an ashen\\nface.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your\\nniece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down\\nand talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable\\nlane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he\\nstood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold\\nkindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I have no doubt that\\nshe loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover\\nextinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one.\\nShe had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming\\ndownstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about\\none of the servantsâ\\x80\\x99 escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was\\nall perfectly true.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he\\nslept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. In the\\nmiddle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose\\nand, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very\\nstealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your\\ndressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some\\nclothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this\\nstrange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the\\nlight of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious\\ncoronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling\\nwith horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door,\\nwhence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her\\nstealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the\\ngloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing\\nquite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a\\nhorrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she\\nwas gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you,\\nand how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as\\nhe was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow,\\nand ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the\\nmoonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught\\nhim, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one\\nside of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle,\\nyour son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something\\nsuddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his\\nhands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had\\njust observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was\\nendeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs it possible?â\\x80\\x9d gasped the banker.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he\\nfelt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the\\ntrue state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved\\nlittle enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous\\nview, however, and preserved her secret.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,â\\x80\\x9d\\ncried Mr. Holder. â\\x80\\x9cOh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his\\nasking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted\\nto see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How\\ncruelly I have misjudged him!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen I arrived at the house,â\\x80\\x9d continued Holmes, â\\x80\\x9cI at once went very\\ncarefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow\\nwhich might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening\\nbefore, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve\\nimpressions. I passed along the tradesmenâ\\x80\\x99s path, but found it all\\ntrampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the\\nfar side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man,\\nwhose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I\\ncould even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run\\nback swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel\\nmarks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. I\\nthought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of\\nwhom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I\\npassed round the garden without seeing anything more than random\\ntracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable\\nlane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of\\nme.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double\\nline which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was\\nat once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your\\nson. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and\\nas his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it\\nwas obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and\\nfound they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow\\naway while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred\\nyards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where\\nthe snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally,\\nwhere a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not\\nmistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge\\nof blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the\\nhighroad at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared,\\nso there was an end to that clue.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill\\nand framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see\\nthat someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an\\ninstep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then\\nbeginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man\\nhad waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed\\nhad been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled\\nwith him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength\\ncausing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had\\nreturned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his\\nopponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and\\nwho was it brought him the coronet?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible,\\nwhatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew\\nthat it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained\\nyour niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son\\nallow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible\\nreason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent\\nexplanation why he should retain her secretâ\\x80\\x94the more so as the secret\\nwas a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that\\nwindow, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my\\nconjecture became a certainty.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for\\nwho else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to\\nyou? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends\\nwas a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had\\nheard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It\\nmust have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems.\\nEven though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still\\nflatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word\\nwithout compromising his own family.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I\\nwent in the shape of a loafer to Sir Georgeâ\\x80\\x99s house, managed to pick up\\nan acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his\\nhead the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings,\\nmade all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I\\njourneyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the\\ntracks.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr.\\nHolder.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrecisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and\\nchanged my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then,\\nfor I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I\\nknew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the\\nmatter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything.\\nBut when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to\\nbluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man,\\nhowever, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike.\\nThen he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give\\nhim a price for the stones he heldâ\\x80\\x94Â£ 1000 apiece. That brought out the\\nfirst signs of grief that he had shown. â\\x80\\x98Why, dash it all!â\\x80\\x99 said he,\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ve let them go at six hundred for the three!â\\x80\\x99 I soon managed to get\\nthe address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there\\nwould be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I\\ngot our stones at Â£ 1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told\\nhim that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two oâ\\x80\\x99clock,\\nafter what I may call a really hard dayâ\\x80\\x99s work.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA day which has saved England from a great public scandal,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nbanker, rising. â\\x80\\x9cSir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall\\nnot find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed\\nexceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy\\nto apologise to him for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you\\ntell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can\\ninform me where she is now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think that we may safely say,â\\x80\\x9d returned Holmes, â\\x80\\x9cthat she is\\nwherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that\\nwhatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient\\npunishment.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\nXII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo the man who loves art for its own sake,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Sherlock Holmes,\\ntossing aside the advertisement sheet of _The Daily Telegraph_, â\\x80\\x9cit is\\nfrequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the\\nkeenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe,\\nWatson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little\\nrecords of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I\\nam bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence\\nnot so much to the many _causes cÃ©lÃ¨bres_ and sensational trials in\\nwhich I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been\\ntrivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of\\ndeduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special\\nprovince.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd yet,â\\x80\\x9d said I, smiling, â\\x80\\x9cI cannot quite hold myself absolved from\\nthe charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have erred, perhaps,â\\x80\\x9d he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with\\nthe tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont\\nto replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a\\nmeditative moodâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cyou have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and\\nlife into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the\\ntask of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect\\nwhich is really the only notable feature about the thing.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,â\\x80\\x9d I\\nremarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I\\nhad more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friendâ\\x80\\x99s\\nsingular character.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, it is not selfishness or conceit,â\\x80\\x9d said he, answering, as was his\\nwont, my thoughts rather than my words. â\\x80\\x9cIf I claim full justice for my\\nart, it is because it is an impersonal thingâ\\x80\\x94a thing beyond myself.\\nCrime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather\\nthan upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what\\nshould have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast\\non either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A\\nthick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the\\nopposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy\\nyellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and\\nglimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet.\\nSherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously\\ninto the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last,\\nhaving apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet\\ntemper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt the same time,â\\x80\\x9d he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat\\npuffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, â\\x80\\x9cyou can hardly\\nbe open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you\\nhave been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not\\ntreat of crime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I\\nendeavoured to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of\\nMiss Mary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the\\ntwisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters\\nwhich are outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational,\\nI fear that you may have bordered on the trivial.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe end may have been so,â\\x80\\x9d I answered, â\\x80\\x9cbut the methods I hold to have\\nbeen novel and of interest.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant\\npublic, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by\\nhis left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction!\\nBut, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot blame you, for the days of\\nthe great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all\\nenterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it seems to\\nbe degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and\\ngiving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I\\nhave touched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning\\nmarks my zero-point, I fancy. Read it!â\\x80\\x9d He tossed a crumpled letter\\nacross to me.\\n\\nIt was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran\\nthus:\\n\\n    â\\x80\\x9cDEAR MR. HOLMES,â\\x80\\x94I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I\\n    should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to\\n    me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do\\n    not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,\\n\\n\\n    â\\x80\\x9cVIOLET HUNTER.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you know the young lady?â\\x80\\x9d I asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot I.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is half-past ten now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember\\nthat the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim\\nat first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this\\ncase, also.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for\\nhere, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was\\nplainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a\\nploverâ\\x80\\x99s egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own\\nway to make in the world.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,â\\x80\\x9d said she, as my\\ncompanion rose to greet her, â\\x80\\x9cbut I have had a very strange experience,\\nand as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask\\nadvice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what\\nI should do.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I\\ncan to serve you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and\\nspeech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion,\\nand then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips\\ntogether, to listen to her story.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have been a governess for five years,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cin the family of\\nColonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an\\nappointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to\\nAmerica with him, so that I found myself without a situation. I\\nadvertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success. At last\\nthe little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my\\nwitâ\\x80\\x99s end as to what I should do.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called\\nWestawayâ\\x80\\x99s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see\\nwhether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the\\nname of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss\\nStoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are\\nseeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by\\none, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything\\nwhich would suit them.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as\\nusual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout\\nman with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down\\nin fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of\\nglasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered.\\nAs I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to\\nMiss Stoper.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98That will do,â\\x80\\x99 said he; â\\x80\\x98I could not ask for anything better.\\nCapital! capital!â\\x80\\x99 He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands\\ntogether in the most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking\\nman that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98You are looking for a situation, miss?â\\x80\\x99 he asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Yes, sir.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98As governess?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Yes, sir.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98And what salary do you ask?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I had Â£ 4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Oh, tut, tut! sweatingâ\\x80\\x94rank sweating!â\\x80\\x99 he cried, throwing his fat\\nhands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. â\\x80\\x98How\\ncould anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and\\naccomplishments?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,â\\x80\\x99 said I. â\\x80\\x98A\\nlittle French, a little German, music, and drawingâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Tut, tut!â\\x80\\x99 he cried. â\\x80\\x98This is all quite beside the question. The\\npoint is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a\\nlady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted\\nfor the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in\\nthe history of the country. But if you have why, then, how could any\\ngentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three\\nfigures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at Â£ 100 a year.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an\\noffer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing\\nperhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and\\ntook out a note.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98It is also my custom,â\\x80\\x99 said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion\\nuntil his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white\\ncreases of his face, â\\x80\\x98to advance to my young ladies half their salary\\nbeforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey\\nand their wardrobe.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful\\na man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a\\ngreat convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the\\nwhole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I\\nquite committed myself.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98May I ask where you live, sir?â\\x80\\x99 said I.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on\\nthe far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear\\nyoung lady, and the dearest old country-house.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98One childâ\\x80\\x94one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could\\nsee him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three\\ngone before you could wink!â\\x80\\x99 He leaned back in his chair and laughed\\nhis eyes into his head again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was a little startled at the nature of the childâ\\x80\\x99s amusement, but\\nthe fatherâ\\x80\\x99s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98My sole duties, then,â\\x80\\x99 I asked, â\\x80\\x98are to take charge of a single\\nchild?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,â\\x80\\x99 he cried.\\nâ\\x80\\x98Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to\\nobey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they\\nwere such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no\\ndifficulty, heh?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I should be happy to make myself useful.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you\\nknowâ\\x80\\x94faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which\\nwe might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 said I, considerably astonished at his words.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Oh, no.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my\\nhair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut.\\nIt has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in\\nthis offhand fashion.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I am afraid that that is quite impossible,â\\x80\\x99 said I. He had been\\nwatching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow\\npass over his face as I spoke.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I am afraid that it is quite essential,â\\x80\\x99 said he. â\\x80\\x98It is a little\\nfancy of my wifeâ\\x80\\x99s, and ladiesâ\\x80\\x99 fancies, you know, madam, ladiesâ\\x80\\x99\\nfancies must be consulted. And so you wonâ\\x80\\x99t cut your hair?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98No, sir, I really could not,â\\x80\\x99 I answered firmly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity,\\nbecause in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In\\nthat case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young\\nladies.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a\\nword to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance\\nupon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a\\nhandsome commission through my refusal.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?â\\x80\\x99 she asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98If you please, Miss Stoper.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most\\nexcellent offers in this fashion,â\\x80\\x99 said she sharply. â\\x80\\x98You can hardly\\nexpect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you.\\nGood-day to you, Miss Hunter.â\\x80\\x99 She struck a gong upon the table, and I\\nwas shown out by the page.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little\\nenough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, I began\\nto ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all,\\nif these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most\\nextraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their\\neccentricity. Very few governesses in England are getting Â£ 100 a year.\\nBesides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by\\nwearing it short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I\\nwas inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I\\nwas sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to\\nthe agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received\\nthis letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here and I will read\\nit to you:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.\\n\\n    â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98DEAR MISS HUNTER,â\\x80\\x94Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your\\n    address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have\\n    reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you should\\n    come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you. We\\n    are willing to give Â£ 30 a quarter, or Â£ 120 a year, so as to\\n    recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may\\n    cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is fond\\n    of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear\\n    such a dress indoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to\\n    the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear\\n    daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which would, I should think,\\n    fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing\\n    yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no\\n    inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity,\\n    especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our\\n    short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this\\n    point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you\\n    for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are\\n    very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the\\n    dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train. Yours faithfully,\\n\\n\\n    â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98JEPHRO RUCASTLE.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind\\nis made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before\\ntaking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your\\nconsideration.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the\\nquestion,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, smiling.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you would not advise me to refuse?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a\\nsister of mine apply for.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed\\nsome opinion?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle\\nseemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his\\nwife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear\\nshe should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in\\nevery way in order to prevent an outbreak?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is a possible solutionâ\\x80\\x94in fact, as matters stand, it is the most\\nprobable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household\\nfor a young lady.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, yes, of course the pay is goodâ\\x80\\x94too good. That is what makes me\\nuneasy. Why should they give you Â£ 120 a year, when they could have\\ntheir pick for Â£ 40? There must be some strong reason behind.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand\\nafterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I\\nfelt that you were at the back of me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your\\nlittle problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my\\nway for some months. There is something distinctly novel about some of\\nthe features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in dangerâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDanger! What danger do you foresee?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHolmes shook his head gravely. â\\x80\\x9cIt would cease to be a danger if we\\ncould define it,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cBut at any time, day or night, a telegram\\nwould bring me down to your help.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is enough.â\\x80\\x9d She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all\\nswept from her face. â\\x80\\x9cI shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my\\nmind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair\\nto-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow.â\\x80\\x9d With a few grateful\\nwords to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her\\nway.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt least,â\\x80\\x9d said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the\\nstairs, â\\x80\\x9cshe seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take\\ncare of herself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd she would need to be,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes gravely. â\\x80\\x9cI am much mistaken if\\nwe do not hear from her before many days are past.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was not very long before my friendâ\\x80\\x99s prediction was fulfilled. A\\nfortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning\\nin her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human\\nexperience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the\\ncurious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something\\nabnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a\\nphilanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to\\ndetermine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an\\nhour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the\\nmatter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. â\\x80\\x9cData! data!\\ndata!â\\x80\\x9d he cried impatiently. â\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t make bricks without clay.â\\x80\\x9d And\\nyet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should\\never have accepted such a situation.\\n\\nThe telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I\\nwas thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those\\nall-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I\\nwould leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and\\nfind him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the\\nmorning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the\\nmessage, threw it across to me.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust look up the trains in Bradshaw,â\\x80\\x9d said he, and turned back to his\\nchemical studies.\\n\\nThe summons was a brief and urgent one.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPlease be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow,â\\x80\\x9d\\nit said. â\\x80\\x9cDo come! I am at my witâ\\x80\\x99s end.\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHUNTER.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWill you come with me?â\\x80\\x9d asked Holmes, glancing up.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should wish to.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust look it up, then.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is a train at half-past nine,â\\x80\\x9d said I, glancing over my\\nBradshaw. â\\x80\\x9cIt is due at Winchester at 11:30.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my\\nanalysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the\\nmorning.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBy eleven oâ\\x80\\x99clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old\\nEnglish capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the\\nway down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them\\ndown and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a\\nlight blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across\\nfrom west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was\\nan exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a manâ\\x80\\x99s energy.\\nAll over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot,\\nthe little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from\\namid the light green of the new foliage.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre they not fresh and beautiful?â\\x80\\x9d I cried with all the enthusiasm of\\na man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.\\n\\nBut Holmes shook his head gravely.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you know, Watson,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cthat it is one of the curses of a mind\\nwith a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to\\nmy own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are\\nimpressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which\\ncomes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with\\nwhich crime may be committed there.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood heavens!â\\x80\\x9d I cried. â\\x80\\x9cWho would associate crime with these dear old\\nhomesteads?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson,\\nfounded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London\\ndo not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and\\nbeautiful countryside.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou horrify me!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do\\nin the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile\\nthat the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkardâ\\x80\\x99s blow,\\ndoes not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then\\nthe whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of\\ncomplaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime\\nand the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields,\\nfilled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the\\nlaw. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which\\nmay go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had\\nthis lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I\\nshould never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country\\nwhich makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally\\nthreatened.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite so. She has her freedom.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat _can_ be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover\\nthe facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can\\nonly be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt\\nfind waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we\\nshall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance\\nfrom the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. She\\nhad engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am so delighted that you have come,â\\x80\\x9d she said earnestly. â\\x80\\x9cIt is so\\nvery kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your\\nadvice will be altogether invaluable to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPray tell us what has happened to you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to\\nbe back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning,\\nthough he little knew for what purpose.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet us have everything in its due order.â\\x80\\x9d Holmes thrust his long thin\\nlegs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no\\nactual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to\\nthem to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my\\nmind about them.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat can you not understand?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTheir reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it\\noccurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in\\nhis dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully\\nsituated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square\\nblock of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp\\nand bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and\\non the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton highroad,\\nwhich curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This\\nground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part\\nof Lord Southertonâ\\x80\\x99s preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately\\nin front of the hall door has given its name to the place.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was\\nintroduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no\\ntruth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable\\nin your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to\\nbe a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more\\nthan thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than\\nforty-five. From their conversation I have gathered that they have been\\nmarried about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only\\nchild by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia.\\nMr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them\\nwas that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As the\\ndaughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that\\nher position must have been uncomfortable with her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s young wife.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in\\nfeature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a\\nnonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to\\nher husband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered\\ncontinually from one to the other, noting every little want and\\nforestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff,\\nboisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple.\\nAnd yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost\\nin deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I\\nhave surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the\\ndisposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never\\nmet so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is\\nsmall for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large.\\nHis whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage\\nfits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any\\ncreature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and\\nhe shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice,\\nlittle birds, and insects. But I would rather not talk about the\\ncreature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am glad of all details,â\\x80\\x9d remarked my friend, â\\x80\\x9cwhether they seem to\\nyou to be relevant or not.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant\\nthing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and\\nconduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife.\\nToller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled\\nhair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have\\nbeen with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to\\ntake no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a\\nsour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a\\nmost unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the\\nnursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of\\nthe building.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very\\nquiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and\\nwhispered something to her husband.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Oh, yes,â\\x80\\x99 said he, turning to me, â\\x80\\x98we are very much obliged to you,\\nMiss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair.\\nI assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your\\nappearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become\\nyou. You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you\\nwould be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of\\nblue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore\\nunmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been a\\nbetter fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle\\nexpressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated\\nin its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which\\nis a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house,\\nwith three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been\\nplaced close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In\\nthis I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on\\nthe other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest\\nstories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he\\nwas, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who\\nhas evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with\\nher hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an\\nhour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence\\nthe duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to\\nlittle Edward in the nursery.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTwo days later this same performance was gone through under exactly\\nsimilar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the\\nwindow, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which\\nmy employer had an immense _rÃ©pertoire_, and which he told inimitably.\\nThen he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little\\nsideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me\\nto read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the\\nheart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he\\nordered me to cease and to change my dress.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what\\nthe meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They\\nwere always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the\\nwindow, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going\\non behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon\\ndevised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought\\nseized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On\\nthe next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief\\nup to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that\\nthere was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was\\nnothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance,\\nhowever, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton\\nRoad, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in\\nmy direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually\\npeople there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings which\\nbordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my\\nhandkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon\\nme with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced\\nthat she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what\\nwas behind me. She rose at once.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Jephro,â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98there is an impertinent fellow upon the road\\nthere who stares up at Miss Hunter.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?â\\x80\\x99 he asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98No, I know no one in these parts.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to\\ngo away.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Surely it would be better to take no notice.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round\\nand wave him away like that.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down\\nthe blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again\\nin the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the\\nroad.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPray continue,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes. â\\x80\\x9cYour narrative promises to be a most\\ninteresting one.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to\\nbe little relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On\\nthe very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took\\nme to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we\\napproached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as\\nof a large animal moving about.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Look in here!â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two\\nplanks. â\\x80\\x98Is he not a beauty?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague\\nfigure huddled up in the darkness.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Donâ\\x80\\x99t be frightened,â\\x80\\x99 said my employer, laughing at the start which I\\nhad given. â\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really\\nold Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We\\nfeed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as\\nkeen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the\\ntrespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodnessâ\\x80\\x99 sake donâ\\x80\\x99t you\\never on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for itâ\\x80\\x99s\\nas much as your life is worth.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look\\nout of my bedroom window about two oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the morning. It was a\\nbeautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was\\nsilvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the\\npeaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was\\nmoving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the\\nmoonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf,\\ntawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting\\nbones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow\\nupon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart\\nwhich I do not think that any burglar could have done.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you\\nknow, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at\\nthe bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I\\nbegan to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by\\nrearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers in\\nthe room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I\\nhad filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack\\naway I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer.\\nIt struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I\\ntook out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first key\\nfitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one\\nthing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It\\nwas my coil of hair.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and\\nthe same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded\\nitself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With\\ntrembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew\\nfrom the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I\\nassure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle\\nas I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned\\nthe strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the\\nRucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a\\ndrawer which they had locked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I\\nsoon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was\\none wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door\\nwhich faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into\\nthis suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I\\nascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door,\\nhis keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very\\ndifferent person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His\\ncheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins\\nstood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried\\npast me without a word or a look.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the\\ngrounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could\\nsee the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a\\nrow, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered\\nup. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down,\\nglancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as\\nmerry and jovial as ever.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Ah!â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98you must not think me rude if I passed you without a\\nword, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI assured him that I was not offended. â\\x80\\x98By the way,â\\x80\\x99 said I, â\\x80\\x98you seem\\nto have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the\\nshutters up.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my\\nremark.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Photography is one of my hobbies,â\\x80\\x99 said he. â\\x80\\x98I have made my dark room\\nup there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon.\\nWho would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?â\\x80\\x99 He spoke\\nin a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at\\nme. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was\\nsomething about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all\\non fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my\\nshare of that. It was more a feeling of dutyâ\\x80\\x94a feeling that some good\\nmight come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of womanâ\\x80\\x99s\\ninstinct; perhaps it was womanâ\\x80\\x99s instinct which gave me that feeling.\\nAt any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any\\nchance to pass the forbidden door.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that,\\nbesides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in\\nthese deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen\\nbag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and\\nyesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was\\nthe key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there.\\nMr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with\\nthem, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently\\nin the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted,\\nwhich turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner\\nwere three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open.\\nThey each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows\\nin the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening\\nlight glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and\\nacross the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an\\niron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at\\nthe other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the\\nkey was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the\\nshuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from\\nbeneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a\\nskylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage\\ngazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, I\\nsuddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass\\nbackward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone\\nout from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the\\nsight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I\\nturned and ranâ\\x80\\x94ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me\\nclutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through\\nthe door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting\\noutside.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98So,â\\x80\\x99 said he, smiling, â\\x80\\x98it was you, then. I thought that it must be\\nwhen I saw the door open.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Oh, I am so frightened!â\\x80\\x99 I panted.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98My dear young lady! my dear young lady!â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94you cannot think how\\ncaressing and soothing his manner wasâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98and what has frightened you, my\\ndear young lady?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was\\nkeenly on my guard against him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,â\\x80\\x99 I answered. â\\x80\\x98But it\\nis so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran\\nout again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Only that?â\\x80\\x99 said he, looking at me keenly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Why, what did you think?â\\x80\\x99 I asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Why do you think that I lock this door?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I am sure that I do not know.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?â\\x80\\x99 He\\nwas still smiling in the most amiable manner.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I am sure if I had knownâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that\\nthreshold againâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of\\nrage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demonâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ll throw you\\nto the mastiff.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I\\nmust have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I\\nfound myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you,\\nMr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was\\nfrightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants,\\neven of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring\\nyou down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house,\\nbut my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon\\nmade up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down\\nto the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then\\nreturned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind\\nas I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered\\nthat Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that\\nevening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had\\nany influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him\\nfree. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at\\nthe thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come\\ninto Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three oâ\\x80\\x99clock,\\nfor Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all\\nthe evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you\\nall my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could\\ntell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHolmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My\\nfriend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his\\npockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs Toller still drunk?â\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing\\nwith him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs there a cellar with a good strong lock?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, the wine-cellar.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave\\nand sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one\\nmore feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite\\nexceptional woman.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will try. What is it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven oâ\\x80\\x99clock, my friend and I.\\nThe Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be\\nincapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If\\nyou could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the\\nkey upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will do it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course\\nthere is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to\\npersonate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber.\\nThat is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is\\nthe daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to\\nhave gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in\\nheight, figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off,\\nvery possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of\\ncourse, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came\\nupon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of\\nhersâ\\x80\\x94possibly her _fiancÃ©_â\\x80\\x94and no doubt, as you wore the girlâ\\x80\\x99s dress\\nand were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he\\nsaw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was\\nperfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog\\nis let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate\\nwith her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case\\nis the disposition of the child.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat on earth has that to do with it?â\\x80\\x9d I ejaculated.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as\\nto the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Donâ\\x80\\x99t you see\\nthat the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first\\nreal insight into the character of parents by studying their children.\\nThis childâ\\x80\\x99s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for crueltyâ\\x80\\x99s\\nsake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should\\nsuspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in\\ntheir power.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,â\\x80\\x9d cried our client. â\\x80\\x9cA\\nthousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit\\nit. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor\\ncreature.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We\\ncan do nothing until seven oâ\\x80\\x99clock. At that hour we shall be with you,\\nand it will not be long before we solve the mystery.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the\\nCopper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The\\ngroup of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in\\nthe light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even\\nhad Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave you managed it?â\\x80\\x9d asked Holmes.\\n\\nA loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. â\\x80\\x9cThat is Mrs.\\nToller in the cellar,â\\x80\\x9d said she. â\\x80\\x9cHer husband lies snoring on the\\nkitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr.\\nRucastleâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have done well indeed!â\\x80\\x9d cried Holmes with enthusiasm. â\\x80\\x9cNow lead\\nthe way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage,\\nand found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had\\ndescribed. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he\\ntried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came\\nfrom within, and at the silence Holmesâ\\x80\\x99 face clouded over.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI trust that we are not too late,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cI think, Miss Hunter,\\nthat we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to\\nit, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength.\\nTogether we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture\\nsave a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The\\nskylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere has been some villainy here,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes; â\\x80\\x9cthis beauty has\\nguessed Miss Hunterâ\\x80\\x99s intentions and has carried his victim off.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut how?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThrough the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.â\\x80\\x9d He swung\\nhimself up onto the roof. â\\x80\\x9cAh, yes,â\\x80\\x9d he cried, â\\x80\\x9chereâ\\x80\\x99s the end of a\\nlong light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut it is impossible,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Hunter; â\\x80\\x9cthe ladder was not there\\nwhen the Rucastles went away.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and\\ndangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he\\nwhose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be\\nas well for you to have your pistol ready.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the\\ndoor of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his\\nhand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of\\nhim, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou villain!â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cwhereâ\\x80\\x99s your daughter?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is for me to ask you that,â\\x80\\x9d he shrieked, â\\x80\\x9cyou thieves! Spies and\\nthieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll serve\\nyou!â\\x80\\x9d He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s gone for the dog!â\\x80\\x9d cried Miss Hunter.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have my revolver,â\\x80\\x9d said I.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBetter close the front door,â\\x80\\x9d cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the\\nstairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the\\nbaying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying\\nsound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red\\nface and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy God!â\\x80\\x9d he cried. â\\x80\\x9cSomeone has loosed the dog. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not been fed for\\ntwo days. Quick, quick, or itâ\\x80\\x99ll be too late!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHolmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller\\nhurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle\\nburied in Rucastleâ\\x80\\x99s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the\\nground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its\\nkeen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. With\\nmuch labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly\\nmangled, into the house. We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and\\nhaving dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I\\ndid what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him\\nwhen the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMrs. Toller!â\\x80\\x9d cried Miss Hunter.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up\\nto you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didnâ\\x80\\x99t let me know what you were\\nplanning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHa!â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, looking keenly at her. â\\x80\\x9cIt is clear that Mrs. Toller\\nknows more about this matter than anyone else.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points\\non which I must confess that I am still in the dark.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will soon make it clear to you,â\\x80\\x9d said she; â\\x80\\x9cand Iâ\\x80\\x99d have done so\\nbefore now if I could haâ\\x80\\x99 got out from the cellar. If thereâ\\x80\\x99s\\npolice-court business over this, youâ\\x80\\x99ll remember that I was the one\\nthat stood your friend, and that I was Miss Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s friend too.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasnâ\\x80\\x99t, from the time that her\\nfather married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything,\\nbut it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler\\nat a friendâ\\x80\\x99s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of\\nher own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she\\nnever said a word about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastleâ\\x80\\x99s\\nhands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a\\nhusband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give\\nhim, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her\\nto sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her\\nmoney. When she wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t do it, he kept on worrying her until she got\\nbrain-fever, and for six weeks was at deathâ\\x80\\x99s door. Then she got better\\nat last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but\\nthat didnâ\\x80\\x99t make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as\\ntrue as man could be.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, â\\x80\\x9cI think that what you have been good enough to tell\\nus makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that\\nremains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of\\nimprisonment?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the\\ndisagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat was it, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be,\\nblockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments,\\nmetallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the\\nsame as his.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs.\\nToller serenely.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of\\ndrink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master\\nhad gone out.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have it, sir, just as it happened.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,â\\x80\\x9d said Holmes, â\\x80\\x9cfor you\\nhave certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes\\nthe country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had\\nbest escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our\\n_locus standi_ now is rather a questionable one.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper\\nbeeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a\\nbroken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife.\\nThey still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of\\nRucastleâ\\x80\\x99s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr.\\nFowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in\\nSouthampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a\\ngovernment appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet\\nHunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no\\nfurther interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of\\none of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at\\nWalsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, by \\nArthur Conan Doyle\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 1661-0.txt or 1661-0.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/6/6/1661/\\n\\nProduced by an anonymous Project Gutenberg volunteer and Jose Menendez\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

the beryl coronet    xii    the adventure of the copper beeches    i  a scandal in bohemia   i   to sherlock holmes she is always  the  woman  i have seldom heard him mention her under any other name  in his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex  it was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for irene adler  all emotions  and that one particularly  were abhorrent to his cold  precise but admirably balanced mind  he was  i take it  the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen  but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position  he never spoke of the softer passions  save with a gibe and a sneer  they were admirable things for the observer   excellent for drawing the veil from men   s motives and actions  but for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results  grit in a sensitive instrument  or a crack in one of his own high power lenses  would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his  and yet there was but one woman to him  and that woman was the late irene adler  of dubious and questionable memory   i had seen little of holmes lately  my marriage had drifted us away from each other  my own complete happiness  and the home centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment  were sufficient to absorb all my attention  while holmes  who loathed every form of society with his whole bohemian soul  remained in our lodgings in baker street  buried among his old books  and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition  the drowsiness of the drug  and the fierce energy of his own keen nature  he was still  as ever  deeply attracted by the study of crime  and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues  and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police  from time to time i heard some vague account of his doings  of his summons to odessa in the case of the trepoff murder  of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the atkinson brothers at trincomalee  and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of holland  beyond these signs of his activity  however  which i merely shared with all the readers of the daily press  i knew little of my former friend and companion   one night   it was on the twentieth of march         i was returning from a journey to a patient  for i had now returned to civil practice   when my way led me through baker street  as i passed the well remembered door  which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing  and with the dark incidents of the study in scarlet  i was seized with a keen desire to see holmes again  and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers  his rooms were brilliantly lit  and  even as i looked up  i saw his tall  spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind  he was pacing the room swiftly  eagerly  with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him  to me  who knew his every mood and habit  his attitude and manner told their own story  he was at work again  he had risen out of his drug created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem  i rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own   his manner was not effusive  it seldom was  but he was glad  i think  to see me  with hardly a word spoken  but with a kindly eye  he waved me to an armchair  threw across his case of cigars  and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner  then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion      wedlock suits you     he remarked     i think  watson  that you have put on seven and a half pounds since i saw you         seven     i answered      indeed  i should have thought a little more  just a trifle more  i fancy  watson  and in practice again  i observe  you did not tell me that you intended to go into harness         then  how do you know         i see it  i deduce it  how do i know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately  and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl         my dear holmes     said i     this is too much  you would certainly have been burned  had you lived a few centuries ago  it is true that i had a country walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful mess  but as i have changed my clothes i can   t imagine how you deduce it  as to mary jane  she is incorrigible  and my wife has given her notice  but there  again  i fail to see how you work it out      he chuckled to himself and rubbed his long  nervous hands together      it is simplicity itself     said he     my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe  just where the firelight strikes it  the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts  obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it  hence  you see  my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather  and that you had a particularly malignant boot slitting specimen of the london slavey  as to your practice  if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform  with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger  and a bulge on the right side of his top hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope  i must be dull  indeed  if i do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession      i could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction     when i hear you give your reasons     i remarked     the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that i could easily do it myself  though at each successive instance of your reasoning i am baffled until you explain your process  and yet i believe that my eyes are as good as yours         quite so     he answered  lighting a cigarette  and throwing himself down into an armchair     you see  but you do not observe  the distinction is clear  for example  you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room         frequently         how often         well  some hundreds of times         then how many are there         how many  i don   t know         quite so  you have not observed  and yet you have seen  that is just my point  now  i know that there are seventeen steps  because i have both seen and observed  by the way  since you are interested in these little problems  and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences  you may be interested in this     he threw over a sheet of thick  pink tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table     it came by the last post     said he     read it aloud      the note was undated  and without either signature or address      there will call upon you to night  at a quarter to eight o   clock     it said     a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment  your recent services to one of the royal houses of europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated  this account of you we have from all quarters received  be in your chamber then at that hour  and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask         this is indeed a mystery     i remarked     what do you imagine that it means         i have no data yet  it is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data  insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories  instead of theories to suit facts  but the note itself  what do you deduce from it      i carefully examined the writing  and the paper upon which it was written      the man who wrote it was presumably well to do     i remarked  endeavouring to imitate my companion   s processes     such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet  it is peculiarly strong and stiff         peculiar   that is the very word     said holmes     it is not an english paper at all  hold it up to the light      i did so  and saw a large    e    with a small    g     a    p     and a large    g    with a small    t    woven into the texture of the paper      what do you make of that     asked holmes      the name of the maker  no doubt  or his monogram  rather         not at all  the    g    with the small    t    stands for    gesellschaft     which is the german for    company     it is a customary contraction like our    co        p     of course  stands for    papier     now for the    eg     let us glance at our continental gazetteer     he took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves     eglow  eglonitz   here we are  egria  it is in a german speaking country   in bohemia  not far from carlsbad     remarkable as being the scene of the death of wallenstein  and for its numerous glass factories and paper mills     ha  ha  my boy  what do you make of that     his eyes sparkled  and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette      the paper was made in bohemia     i said      precisely  and the man who wrote the note is a german  do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence      this account of you we have from all quarters received     a frenchman or russian could not have written that  it is the german who is so uncourteous to his verbs  it only remains  therefore  to discover what is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face  and here he comes  if i am not mistaken  to resolve all our doubts      as he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses    hoofs and grating wheels against the curb  followed by a sharp pull at the bell  holmes whistled      a pair  by the sound     said he     yes     he continued  glancing out of the window     a nice little brougham and a pair of beauties  a hundred and fifty guineas apiece  there   s money in this case  watson  if there is nothing else         i think that i had better go  holmes         not a bit  doctor  stay where you are  i am lost without my boswell  and this promises to be interesting  it would be a pity to miss it         but your client           never mind him  i may want your help  and so may he  here he comes  sit down in that armchair  doctor  and give us your best attention      a slow and heavy step  which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage  paused immediately outside the door  then there was a loud and authoritative tap      come in     said holmes   a man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height  with the chest and limbs of a hercules  his dress was rich with a richness which would  in england  be looked upon as akin to bad taste  heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double breasted coat  while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl  boots which extended halfway up his calves  and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur  completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance  he carried a broad brimmed hat in his hand  while he wore across the upper part of his face  extending down past the cheekbones  a black vizard mask  which he had apparently adjusted that very moment  for his hand was still raised to it as he entered  from the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character  with a thick  hanging lip  and a long  straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy      you had my note     he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked german accent     i told you that i would call     he looked from one to the other of us  as if uncertain which to address      pray take a seat     said holmes     this is my friend and colleague  dr  watson  who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases  whom have i the honour to address         you may address me as the count von kramm  a bohemian nobleman  i understand that this gentleman  your friend  is a man of honour and discretion  whom i may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance  if not  i should much prefer to communicate with you alone      i rose to go  but holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair     it is both  or none     said he     you may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me      the count shrugged his broad shoulders     then i must begin     said he     by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years  at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance  at present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon european history         i promise     said holmes      and i         you will excuse this mask     continued our strange visitor     the august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you  and i may confess at once that the title by which i have just called myself is not exactly my own         i was aware of it     said holmes dryly      the circumstances are of great delicacy  and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of europe  to speak plainly  the matter implicates the great house of ormstein  hereditary kings of bohemia         i was also aware of that     murmured holmes  settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes   our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid  lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in europe  holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client      if your majesty would condescend to state your case     he remarked     i should be better able to advise you      the man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation  then  with a gesture of desperation  he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground     you are right     he cried     i am the king  why should i attempt to conceal it         why  indeed     murmured holmes     your majesty had not spoken before i was aware that i was addressing wilhelm gottsreich sigismond von ormstein  grand duke of cassel felstein  and hereditary king of bohemia         but you can understand     said our strange visitor  sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead     you can understand that i am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person  yet the matter was so delicate that i could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power  i have come  incognito  from prague for the purpose of consulting you         then  pray consult     said holmes  shutting his eyes once more      the facts are briefly these  some five years ago  during a lengthy visit to warsaw  i made the acquaintance of the well known adventuress  irene adler  the name is no doubt familiar to you         kindly look her up in my index  doctor     murmured holmes without opening his eyes  for many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things  so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information  in this case i found her biography sandwiched in between that of a hebrew rabbi and that of a staff commander who had written a monograph upon the deep sea fishes      let me see     said holmes     hum  born in new jersey in the year       contralto   hum  la scala  hum  prima donna imperial opera of warsaw   yes  retired from operatic stage   ha  living in london   quite so  your majesty  as i understand  became entangled with this young person  wrote her some compromising letters  and is now desirous of getting those letters back         precisely so  but how           was there a secret marriage         none         no legal papers or certificates         none         then i fail to follow your majesty  if this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes  how is she to prove their authenticity         there is the writing         pooh  pooh  forgery         my private note paper         stolen         my own seal         imitated         my photograph         bought         we were both in the photograph         oh  dear  that is very bad  your majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion         i was mad   insane         you have compromised yourself seriously         i was only crown prince then  i was young  i am but thirty now         it must be recovered         we have tried and failed         your majesty must pay  it must be bought         she will not sell         stolen  then         five attempts have been made  twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house  once we diverted her luggage when she travelled  twice she has been waylaid  there has been no result         no sign of it         absolutely none      holmes laughed     it is quite a pretty little problem     said he      but a very serious one to me     returned the king reproachfully      very  indeed  and what does she propose to do with the photograph         to ruin me         but how         i am about to be married         so i have heard         to clotilde lothman von saxe meningen  second daughter of the king of scandinavia  you may know the strict principles of her family  she is herself the very soul of delicacy  a shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end         and irene adler         threatens to send them the photograph  and she will do it  i know that she will do it  you do not know her  but she has a soul of steel  she has the face of the most beautiful of women  and the mind of the most resolute of men  rather than i should marry another woman  there are no lengths to which she would not go   none         you are sure that she has not sent it yet         i am sure         and why         because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed  that will be next monday         oh  then we have three days yet     said holmes with a yawn     that is very fortunate  as i have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present  your majesty will  of course  stay in london for the present         certainly  you will find me at the langham under the name of the count von kramm         then i shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress         pray do so  i shall be all anxiety         then  as to money         you have  carte blanche          absolutely         i tell you that i would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph         and for present expenses      the king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table      there are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes     he said   holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note book and handed it to him      and mademoiselle   s address     he asked      is briony lodge  serpentine avenue  st  john   s wood      holmes took a note of it     one other question     said he     was the photograph a cabinet         it was         then  good night  your majesty  and i trust that we shall soon have some good news for you  and good night  watson     he added  as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street     if you will be good enough to call to morrow afternoon at three o   clock i should like to chat this little matter over with you       ii   at three o   clock precisely i was at baker street  but holmes had not yet returned  the landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o   clock in the morning  i sat down beside the fire  however  with the intention of awaiting him  however long he might be  i was already deeply interested in his inquiry  for  though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which i have already recorded  still  the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own  indeed  apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand  there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation  and his keen  incisive reasoning  which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work  and to follow the quick  subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries  so accustomed was i to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head   it was close upon four before the door opened  and a drunken looking groom  ill kempt and side whiskered  with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes  walked into the room  accustomed as i was to my friend   s amazing powers in the use of disguises  i had to look three times before i was certain that it was indeed he  with a nod he vanished into the bedroom  whence he emerged in five minutes tweed suited and respectable  as of old  putting his hands into his pockets  he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes      well  really     he cried  and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back  limp and helpless  in the chair      what is it         it   s quite too funny  i am sure you could never guess how i employed my morning  or what i ended by doing         i can   t imagine  i suppose that you have been watching the habits  and perhaps the house  of miss irene adler         quite so  but the sequel was rather unusual  i will tell you  however  i left the house a little after eight o   clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work  there is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men  be one of them  and you will know all that there is to know  i soon found briony lodge  it is a  bijou  villa  with a garden at the back  but built out in front right up to the road  two stories  chubb lock to the door  large sitting room on the right side  well furnished  with long windows almost to the floor  and those preposterous english window fasteners which a child could open  behind there was nothing remarkable  save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach house  i walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view  but without noting anything else of interest      i then lounged down the street and found  as i expected  that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden  i lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses  and received in exchange twopence  a glass of half and half  two fills of shag tobacco  and as much information as i could desire about miss adler  to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom i was not in the least interested  but whose biographies i was compelled to listen to         and what of irene adler     i asked      oh  she has turned all the men   s heads down in that part  she is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet  so say the serpentine mews  to a man  she lives quietly  sings at concerts  drives out at five every day  and returns at seven sharp for dinner  seldom goes out at other times  except when she sings  has only one male visitor  but a good deal of him  he is dark  handsome  and dashing  never calls less than once a day  and often twice  he is a mr  godfrey norton  of the inner temple  see the advantages of a cabman as a confidant  they had driven him home a dozen times from serpentine mews  and knew all about him  when i had listened to all they had to tell  i began to walk up and down near briony lodge once more  and to think over my plan of campaign      this godfrey norton was evidently an important factor in the matter  he was a lawyer  that sounded ominous  what was the relation between them  and what the object of his repeated visits  was she his client  his friend  or his mistress  if the former  she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping  if the latter  it was less likely  on the issue of this question depended whether i should continue my work at briony lodge  or turn my attention to the gentleman   s chambers in the temple  it was a delicate point  and it widened the field of my inquiry  i fear that i bore you with these details  but i have to let you see my little difficulties  if you are to understand the situation         i am following you closely     i answered      i was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to briony lodge  and a gentleman sprang out  he was a remarkably handsome man  dark  aquiline  and moustached   evidently the man of whom i had heard  he appeared to be in a great hurry  shouted to the cabman to wait  and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home      he was in the house about half an hour  and i could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting room  pacing up and down  talking excitedly  and waving his arms  of her i could see nothing  presently he emerged  looking even more flurried than before  as he stepped up to the cab  he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly     drive like the devil     he shouted     first to gross   hankey   s in regent street  and then to the church of st  monica in the edgeware road  half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes         away they went  and i was just wondering whether i should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau  the coachman with his coat only half buttoned  and his tie under his ear  while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles  it hadn   t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it  i only caught a glimpse of her at the moment  but she was a lovely woman  with a face that a man might die for         the church of st  monica  john     she cried     and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes         this was quite too good to lose  watson  i was just balancing whether i should run for it  or whether i should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street  the driver looked twice at such a shabby fare  but i jumped in before he could object     the church of st  monica     said i     and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes     it was twenty five minutes to twelve  and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind      my cabby drove fast  i don   t think i ever drove faster  but the others were there before us  the cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when i arrived  i paid the man and hurried into the church  there was not a soul there save the two whom i had followed and a surpliced clergyman  who seemed to be expostulating with them  they were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar  i lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church  suddenly  to my surprise  the three at the altar faced round to me  and godfrey norton came running as hard as he could towards me         thank god     he cried     you   ll do  come  come            what then     i asked         come  man  come  only three minutes  or it won   t be legal         i was half dragged up to the altar  and before i knew where i was i found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear  and vouching for things of which i knew nothing  and generally assisting in the secure tying up of irene adler  spinster  to godfrey norton  bachelor  it was all done in an instant  and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other  while the clergyman beamed on me in front  it was the most preposterous position in which i ever found myself in my life  and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now  it seems that there had been some informality about their license  that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort  and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man  the bride gave me a sovereign  and i mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion         this is a very unexpected turn of affairs     said i     and what then         well  i found my plans very seriously menaced  it looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure  and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part  at the church door  however  they separated  he driving back to the temple  and she to her own house     i shall drive out in the park at five as usual     she said as she left him  i heard no more  they drove away in different directions  and i went off to make my own arrangements         which are         some cold beef and a glass of beer     he answered  ringing the bell     i have been too busy to think of food  and i am likely to be busier still this evening  by the way  doctor  i shall want your co operation         i shall be delighted         you don   t mind breaking the law         not in the least         nor running a chance of arrest         not in a good cause         oh  the cause is excellent         then i am your man         i was sure that i might rely on you         but what is it you wish         when mrs  turner has brought in the tray i will make it clear to you  now     he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided     i must discuss it while i eat  for i have not much time  it is nearly five now  in two hours we must be on the scene of action  miss irene  or madame  rather  returns from her drive at seven  we must be at briony lodge to meet her         and what then         you must leave that to me  i have already arranged what is to occur  there is only one point on which i must insist  you must not interfere  come what may  you understand         i am to be neutral         to do nothing whatever  there will probably be some small unpleasantness  do not join in it  it will end in my being conveyed into the house  four or five minutes afterwards the sitting room window will open  you are to station yourself close to that open window         yes         you are to watch me  for i will be visible to you         yes         and when i raise my hand   so   you will throw into the room what i give you to throw  and will  at the same time  raise the cry of fire  you quite follow me         entirely         it is nothing very formidable     he said  taking a long cigar shaped roll from his pocket     it is an ordinary plumber   s smoke rocket  fitted with a cap at either end to make it self lighting  your task is confined to that  when you raise your cry of fire  it will be taken up by quite a number of people  you may then walk to the end of the street  and i will rejoin you in ten minutes  i hope that i have made myself clear         i am to remain neutral  to get near the window  to watch you  and at the signal to throw in this object  then to raise the cry of fire  and to wait you at the corner of the street         precisely         then you may entirely rely on me         that is excellent  i think  perhaps  it is almost time that i prepare for the new role i have to play      he disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple minded nonconformist clergyman  his broad black hat  his baggy trousers  his white tie  his sympathetic smile  and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as mr  john hare alone could have equalled  it was not merely that holmes changed his costume  his expression  his manner  his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed  the stage lost a fine actor  even as science lost an acute reasoner  when he became a specialist in crime   it was a quarter past six when we left baker street  and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in serpentine avenue  it was already dusk  and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of briony lodge  waiting for the coming of its occupant  the house was just such as i had pictured it from sherlock holmes    succinct description  but the locality appeared to be less private than i expected  on the contrary  for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood  it was remarkably animated  there was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner  a scissors grinder with his wheel  two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse girl  and several well dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths      you see     remarked holmes  as we paced to and fro in front of the house     this marriage rather simplifies matters  the photograph becomes a double edged weapon now  the chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by mr  godfrey norton  as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess  now the question is  where are we to find the photograph         where  indeed         it is most unlikely that she carries it about with her  it is cabinet size  too large for easy concealment about a woman   s dress  she knows that the king is capable of having her waylaid and searched  two attempts of the sort have already been made  we may take it  then  that she does not carry it about with her         where  then         her banker or her lawyer  there is that double possibility  but i am inclined to think neither  women are naturally secretive  and they like to do their own secreting  why should she hand it over to anyone else  she could trust her own guardianship  but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man  besides  remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days  it must be where she can lay her hands upon it  it must be in her own house         but it has twice been burgled         pshaw  they did not know how to look         but how will you look         i will not look         what then         i will get her to show me         but she will refuse         she will not be able to  but i hear the rumble of wheels  it is her carriage  now carry out my orders to the letter      as he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue  it was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of briony lodge  as it pulled up  one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper  but was elbowed away by another loafer  who had rushed up with the same intention  a fierce quarrel broke out  which was increased by the two guardsmen  who took sides with one of the loungers  and by the scissors grinder  who was equally hot upon the other side  a blow was struck  and in an instant the lady  who had stepped from her carriage  was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men  who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks  holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady  but  just as he reached her  he gave a cry and dropped to the ground  with the blood running freely down his face  at his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other  while a number of better dressed people  who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it  crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man  irene adler  as i will still call her  had hurried up the steps  but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall  looking back into the street      is the poor gentleman much hurt     she asked      he is dead     cried several voices      no  no  there   s life in him     shouted another     but he   ll be gone before you can get him to hospital         he   s a brave fellow     said a woman     they would have had the lady   s purse and watch if it hadn   t been for him  they were a gang  and a rough one  too  ah  he   s breathing now         he can   t lie in the street  may we bring him in  marm         surely  bring him into the sitting room  there is a comfortable sofa  this way  please      slowly and solemnly he was borne into briony lodge and laid out in the principal room  while i still observed the proceedings from my post by the window  the lamps had been lit  but the blinds had not been drawn  so that i could see holmes as he lay upon the couch  i do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing  but i know that i never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when i saw the beautiful creature against whom i was conspiring  or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man  and yet it would be the blackest treachery to holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me  i hardened my heart  and took the smoke rocket from under my ulster  after all  i thought  we are not injuring her  we are but preventing her from injuring another   holmes had sat up upon the couch  and i saw him motion like a man who is in need of air  a maid rushed across and threw open the window  at the same instant i saw him raise his hand and at the signal i tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of    fire     the word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators  well dressed and ill   gentlemen  ostlers  and servant maids   joined in a general shriek of    fire     thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window  i caught a glimpse of rushing figures  and a moment later the voice of holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm  slipping through the shouting crowd i made my way to the corner of the street  and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend   s arm in mine  and to get away from the scene of uproar  he walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the edgeware road      you did it very nicely  doctor     he remarked     nothing could have been better  it is all right         you have the photograph         i know where it is         and how did you find out         she showed me  as i told you she would         i am still in the dark         i do not wish to make a mystery     said he  laughing     the matter was perfectly simple  you  of course  saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice  they were all engaged for the evening         i guessed as much         then  when the row broke out  i had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand  i rushed forward  fell down  clapped my hand to my face  and became a piteous spectacle  it is an old trick         that also i could fathom         then they carried me in  she was bound to have me in  what else could she do  and into her sitting room  which was the very room which i suspected  it lay between that and her bedroom  and i was determined to see which  they laid me on a couch  i motioned for air  they were compelled to open the window  and you had your chance         how did that help you         it was all important  when a woman thinks that her house is on fire  her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most  it is a perfectly overpowering impulse  and i have more than once taken advantage of it  in the case of the darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me  and also in the arnsworth castle business  a married woman grabs at her baby  an unmarried one reaches for her jewel box  now it was clear to me that our lady of to day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of  she would rush to secure it  the alarm of fire was admirably done  the smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel  she responded beautifully  the photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell pull  she was there in an instant  and i caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out  when i cried out that it was a false alarm  she replaced it  glanced at the rocket  rushed from the room  and i have not seen her since  i rose  and  making my excuses  escaped from the house  i hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once  but the coachman had come in  and as he was watching me narrowly  it seemed safer to wait  a little over precipitance may ruin all         and now     i asked      our quest is practically finished  i shall call with the king to morrow  and with you  if you care to come with us  we will be shown into the sitting room to wait for the lady  but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph  it might be a satisfaction to his majesty to regain it with his own hands         and when will you call         at eight in the morning  she will not be up  so that we shall have a clear field  besides  we must be prompt  for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits  i must wire to the king without delay      we had reached baker street and had stopped at the door  he was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said      good night  mister sherlock holmes      there were several people on the pavement at the time  but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by      i   ve heard that voice before     said holmes  staring down the dimly lit street     now  i wonder who the deuce that could have been       iii   i slept at baker street that night  and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushed into the room      you have really got it     he cried  grasping sherlock holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face      not yet         but you have hopes         i have hopes         then  come  i am all impatience to be gone         we must have a cab         no  my brougham is waiting         then that will simplify matters     we descended and started off once more for briony lodge      irene adler is married     remarked holmes      married  when         yesterday         but to whom         to an english lawyer named norton         but she could not love him         i am in hopes that she does         and why in hopes         because it would spare your majesty all fear of future annoyance  if the lady loves her husband  she does not love your majesty  if she does not love your majesty  there is no reason why she should interfere with your majesty   s plan         it is true  and yet     well  i wish she had been of my own station  what a queen she would have made     he relapsed into a moody silence  which was not broken until we drew up in serpentine avenue   the door of briony lodge was open  and an elderly woman stood upon the steps  she watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham      mr  sherlock holmes  i believe     said she      i am mr  holmes     answered my companion  looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze      indeed  my mistress told me that you were likely to call  she left this morning with her husband by the      train from charing cross for the continent         what     sherlock holmes staggered back  white with chagrin and surprise     do you mean that she has left england         never to return         and the papers     asked the king hoarsely     all is lost         we shall see     he pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing room  followed by the king and myself  the furniture was scattered about in every direction  with dismantled shelves and open drawers  as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight  holmes rushed at the bell pull  tore back a small sliding shutter  and  plunging in his hand  pulled out a photograph and a letter  the photograph was of irene adler herself in evening dress  the letter was superscribed to    sherlock holmes  esq  to be left till called for     my friend tore it open  and we all three read it together  it was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way          my dear mr  sherlock holmes    you really did it very well  you took     me in completely  until after the alarm of fire  i had not a     suspicion  but then  when i found how i had betrayed myself  i     began to think  i had been warned against you months ago  i had     been told that  if the king employed an agent  it would certainly     be you  and your address had been given me  yet  with all this  you     made me reveal what you wanted to know  even after i became     suspicious  i found it hard to think evil of such a dear  kind old     clergyman  but  you know  i have been trained as an actress myself      male costume is nothing new to me  i often take advantage of the     freedom which it gives  i sent john  the coachman  to watch you      ran upstairs  got into my walking clothes  as i call them  and came     down just as you departed          well  i followed you to your door  and so made sure that i was     really an object of interest to the celebrated mr  sherlock holmes      then i  rather imprudently  wished you good night  and started for     the temple to see my husband          we both thought the best resource was flight  when pursued by so     formidable an antagonist  so you will find the nest empty when you     call to morrow  as to the photograph  your client may rest in     peace  i love and am loved by a better man than he  the king may do     what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly     wronged  i keep it only to safeguard myself  and to preserve a     weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might     take in the future  i leave a photograph which he might care to     possess  and i remain  dear mr  sherlock holmes           very truly yours          irene norton   n  e  adler          what a woman   oh  what a woman     cried the king of bohemia  when we had all three read this epistle     did i not tell you how quick and resolute she was  would she not have made an admirable queen  is it not a pity that she was not on my level         from what i have seen of the lady  she seems  indeed  to be on a very different level to your majesty     said holmes coldly     i am sorry that i have not been able to bring your majesty   s business to a more successful conclusion         on the contrary  my dear sir     cried the king     nothing could be more successful  i know that her word is inviolate  the photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire         i am glad to hear your majesty say so         i am immensely indebted to you  pray tell me in what way i can reward you  this ring       he slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand      your majesty has something which i should value even more highly     said holmes      you have but to name it         this photograph      the king stared at him in amazement      irene   s photograph     he cried     certainly  if you wish it         i thank your majesty  then there is no more to be done in the matter  i have the honour to wish you a very good morning     he bowed  and  turning away without observing the hand which the king had stretched out to him  he set off in my company for his chambers   and that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of bohemia  and how the best plans of mr  sherlock holmes were beaten by a woman   s wit  he used to make merry over the cleverness of women  but i have not heard him do it of late  and when he speaks of irene adler  or when he refers to her photograph  it is always under the honourable title of  the  woman     ii  the red headed league    i had called upon my friend  mr  sherlock holmes  one day in the  autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very  stout  florid faced  elderly gentleman with fiery red hair  with an  apology for my intrusion  i was about to withdraw when holmes pulled  me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me      you could not possibly have come at a better time  my dear watson     he said cordially      i was afraid that you were engaged         so i am  very much so         then i can wait in the next room         not at all  this gentleman  mr  wilson  has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases  and i have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also      the stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting  with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat encircled eyes      try the settee     said holmes  relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together  as was his custom when in judicial moods     i know  my dear watson  that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life  you have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle  and  if you will excuse my saying so  somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures         your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me     i observed      you will remember that i remarked the other day  just before we went into the very simple problem presented by miss mary sutherland  that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself  which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination         a proposition which i took the liberty of doubting         you did  doctor  but none the less you must come round to my view  for otherwise i shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right  now  mr  jabez wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning  and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which i have listened to for some time  you have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes  and occasionally  indeed  where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed  as far as i have heard  it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not  but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that i have ever listened to  perhaps  mr  wilson  you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative  i ask you not merely because my friend dr  watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips  as a rule  when i have heard some slight indication of the course of events  i am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory  in the present instance i am forced to admit that the facts are  to the best of my belief  unique      the portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat  as he glanced down the advertisement column  with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee  i took a good look at the man and endeavoured  after the fashion of my companion  to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance   i did not gain very much  however  by my inspection  our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman  obese  pompous  and slow  he wore rather baggy grey shepherd   s check trousers  a not over clean black frock coat  unbuttoned in the front  and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy albert chain  and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament  a frayed top hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him  altogether  look as i would  there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head  and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features   sherlock holmes    quick eye took in my occupation  and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances     beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour  that he takes snuff  that he is a freemason  that he has been in china  and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately  i can deduce nothing else      mr  jabez wilson started up in his chair  with his forefinger upon the paper  but his eyes upon my companion      how  in the name of good fortune  did you know all that  mr  holmes     he asked     how did you know  for example  that i did manual labour  it   s as true as gospel  for i began as a ship   s carpenter         your hands  my dear sir  your right hand is quite a size larger than your left  you have worked with it  and the muscles are more developed         well  the snuff  then  and the freemasonry         i won   t insult your intelligence by telling you how i read that  especially as  rather against the strict rules of your order  you use an arc and compass breastpin         ah  of course  i forgot that  but the writing         what else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches  and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk         well  but china         the fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in china  i have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject  that trick of staining the fishes    scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to china  when  in addition  i see a chinese coin hanging from your watch chain  the matter becomes even more simple      mr  jabez wilson laughed heavily     well  i never     said he     i thought at first that you had done something clever  but i see that there was nothing in it after all         i begin to think  watson     said holmes     that i make a mistake in explaining      omne ignotum pro magnifico      you know  and my poor little reputation  such as it is  will suffer shipwreck if i am so candid  can you not find the advertisement  mr  wilson         yes  i have got it now     he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column     here it is  this is what began it all  you just read it for yourself  sir      i took the paper from him and read as follows      to the red headed league  on account of the bequest of the late ezekiah hopkins  of lebanon  pennsylvania  u s a   there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the league to a salary of      a week for purely nominal services  all red headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty one years  are eligible  apply in person on monday  at eleven o   clock  to duncan ross  at the offices of the league    pope   s court  fleet street          what on earth does this mean     i ejaculated after i had twice read over the extraordinary announcement   holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair  as was his habit when in high spirits     it is a little off the beaten track  isn   t it     said he     and now  mr  wilson  off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself  your household  and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes  you will first make a note  doctor  of the paper and the date         it is  the morning chronicle  of april           just two months ago         very good  now  mr  wilson         well  it is just as i have been telling you  mr  sherlock holmes     said jabez wilson  mopping his forehead     i have a small pawnbroker   s business at coburg square  near the city  it   s not a very large affair  and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living  i used to be able to keep two assistants  but now i only keep one  and i would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business         what is the name of this obliging youth     asked sherlock holmes      his name is vincent spaulding  and he   s not such a youth  either  it   s hard to say his age  i should not wish a smarter assistant  mr  holmes  and i know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what i am able to give him  but  after all  if he is satisfied  why should i put ideas in his head         why  indeed  you seem most fortunate in having an  employ    who comes under the full market price  it is not a common experience among employers in this age  i don   t know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement         oh  he has his faults  too     said mr  wilson     never was such a fellow for photography  snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind  and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures  that is his main fault  but on the whole he   s a good worker  there   s no vice in him         he is still with you  i presume         yes  sir  he and a girl of fourteen  who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean   that   s all i have in the house  for i am a widower and never had any family  we live very quietly  sir  the three of us  and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts  if we do nothing more      the first thing that put us out was that advertisement  spaulding  he came down into the office just this day eight weeks  with this very paper in his hand  and he says         i wish to the lord  mr  wilson  that i was a red headed man            why that     i asks         why     says he     here   s another vacancy on the league of the red headed men  it   s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it  and i understand that there are more vacancies than there are men  so that the trustees are at their wits    end what to do with the money  if my hair would only change colour  here   s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into            why  what is it  then     i asked  you see  mr  holmes  i am a very stay at home man  and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it  i was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door mat  in that way i didn   t know much of what was going on outside  and i was always glad of a bit of news         have you never heard of the league of the red headed men     he asked with his eyes open         never            why  i wonder at that  for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies            and what are they worth     i asked         oh  merely a couple of hundred a year  but the work is slight  and it need not interfere very much with one   s other occupations         well  you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears  for the business has not been over good for some years  and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy         tell me all about it     said i         well     said he  showing me the advertisement     you can see for yourself that the league has a vacancy  and there is the address where you should apply for particulars  as far as i can make out  the league was founded by an american millionaire  ezekiah hopkins  who was very peculiar in his ways  he was himself red headed  and he had a great sympathy for all red headed men  so  when he died  it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees  with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour  from all i hear it is splendid pay and very little to do            but     said i     there would be millions of red headed men who would apply            not so many as you might think     he answered     you see it is really confined to londoners  and to grown men  this american had started from london when he was young  and he wanted to do the old town a good turn  then  again  i have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red  or dark red  or anything but real bright  blazing  fiery red  now  if you cared to apply  mr  wilson  you would just walk in  but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds         now  it is a fact  gentlemen  as you may see for yourselves  that my hair is of a very full and rich tint  so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter i stood as good a chance as any man that i had ever met  vincent spaulding seemed to know so much about it that i thought he might prove useful  so i just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me  he was very willing to have a holiday  so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement      i never hope to see such a sight as that again  mr  holmes  from north  south  east  and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement  fleet street was choked with red headed folk  and pope   s court looked like a coster   s orange barrow  i should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement  every shade of colour they were   straw  lemon  orange  brick  irish setter  liver  clay  but  as spaulding said  there were not many who had the real vivid flame coloured tint  when i saw how many were waiting  i would have given it up in despair  but spaulding would not hear of it  how he did it i could not imagine  but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd  and right up to the steps which led to the office  there was a double stream upon the stair  some going up in hope  and some coming back dejected  but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office         your experience has been a most entertaining one     remarked holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff     pray continue your very interesting statement         there was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table  behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine  he said a few words to each candidate as he came up  and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them  getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter  after all  however  when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others  and he closed the door as we entered  so that he might have a private word with us         this is mr  jabez wilson     said my assistant     and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the league            and he is admirably suited for it     the other answered     he has every requirement  i cannot recall when i have seen anything so fine     he took a step backward  cocked his head on one side  and gazed at my hair until i felt quite bashful  then suddenly he plunged forward  wrung my hand  and congratulated me warmly on my success         it would be injustice to hesitate     said he     you will  however  i am sure  excuse me for taking an obvious precaution     with that he seized my hair in both his hands  and tugged until i yelled with the pain     there is water in your eyes     said he as he released me     i perceive that all is as it should be  but we have to be careful  for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint  i could tell you tales of cobbler   s wax which would disgust you with human nature     he stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled  a groan of disappointment came up from below  and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red head to be seen except my own and that of the manager         my name     said he     is mr  duncan ross  and i am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor  are you a married man  mr  wilson  have you a family         i answered that i had not      his face fell immediately         dear me     he said gravely     that is very serious indeed  i am sorry to hear you say that  the fund was  of course  for the propagation and spread of the red heads as well as for their maintenance  it is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor         my face lengthened at this  mr  holmes  for i thought that i was not to have the vacancy after all  but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right         in the case of another     said he     the objection might be fatal  but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours  when shall you be able to enter upon your new duties            well  it is a little awkward  for i have a business already     said i         oh  never mind about that  mr  wilson     said vincent spaulding     i should be able to look after that for you            what would be the hours     i asked         ten to two         now a pawnbroker   s business is mostly done of an evening  mr  holmes  especially thursday and friday evening  which is just before pay day  so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings  besides  i knew that my assistant was a good man  and that he would see to anything that turned up         that would suit me very well     said i     and the pay            is      a week            and the work            is purely nominal            what do you call purely nominal            well  you have to be in the office  or at least in the building  the whole time  if you leave  you forfeit your whole position forever  the will is very clear upon that point  you don   t comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time            it   s only four hours a day  and i should not think of leaving     said i         no excuse will avail     said mr  duncan ross     neither sickness nor business nor anything else  there you must stay  or you lose your billet            and the work            is to copy out the  encyclop  dia britannica   there is the first volume of it in that press  you must find your own ink  pens  and blotting paper  but we provide this table and chair  will you be ready to morrow            certainly     i answered         then  good bye  mr  jabez wilson  and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain     he bowed me out of the room and i went home with my assistant  hardly knowing what to say or do  i was so pleased at my own good fortune      well  i thought over the matter all day  and by evening i was in low spirits again  for i had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud  though what its object might be i could not imagine  it seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will  or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the  encyclop  dia britannica   vincent spaulding did what he could to cheer me up  but by bedtime i had reasoned myself out of the whole thing  however  in the morning i determined to have a look at it anyhow  so i bought a penny bottle of ink  and with a quill pen  and seven sheets of foolscap paper  i started off for pope   s court      well  to my surprise and delight  everything was as right as possible  the table was set out ready for me  and mr  duncan ross was there to see that i got fairly to work  he started me off upon the letter a  and then he left me  but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me  at two o   clock he bade me good day  complimented me upon the amount that i had written  and locked the door of the office after me      this went on day after day  mr  holmes  and on saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week   s work  it was the same next week  and the same the week after  every morning i was there at ten  and every afternoon i left at two  by degrees mr  duncan ross took to coming in only once of a morning  and then  after a time  he did not come in at all  still  of course  i never dared to leave the room for an instant  for i was not sure when he might come  and the billet was such a good one  and suited me so well  that i would not risk the loss of it      eight weeks passed away like this  and i had written about abbots and archery and armour and architecture and attica  and hoped with diligence that i might get on to the b   s before very long  it cost me something in foolscap  and i had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings  and then suddenly the whole business came to an end         to an end         yes  sir  and no later than this morning  i went to my work as usual at ten o   clock  but the door was shut and locked  with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack  here it is  and you can read for yourself      he held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note paper  it read in this fashion      the red headed league is dissolved  october               sherlock holmes and i surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it  until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter      i cannot see that there is anything very funny     cried our client  flushing up to the roots of his flaming head     if you can do nothing better than laugh at me  i can go elsewhere         no  no     cried holmes  shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen     i really wouldn   t miss your case for the world  it is most refreshingly unusual  but there is  if you will excuse my saying so  something just a little funny about it  pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door         i was staggered  sir  i did not know what to do  then i called at the offices round  but none of them seemed to know anything about it  finally  i went to the landlord  who is an accountant living on the ground floor  and i asked him if he could tell me what had become of the red headed league  he said that he had never heard of any such body  then i asked him who mr  duncan ross was  he answered that the name was new to him         well     said i     the gentleman at no               what  the red headed man            yes            oh     said he     his name was william morris  he was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready  he moved out yesterday            where could i find him            oh  at his new offices  he did tell me the address  yes     king edward street  near st  paul   s         i started off  mr  holmes  but when i got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee caps  and no one in it had ever heard of either mr  william morris or mr  duncan ross         and what did you do then     asked holmes      i went home to saxe coburg square  and i took the advice of my assistant  but he could not help me in any way  he could only say that if i waited i should hear by post  but that was not quite good enough  mr  holmes  i did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle  so  as i had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it  i came right away to you         and you did very wisely     said holmes     your case is an exceedingly remarkable one  and i shall be happy to look into it  from what you have told me i think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear         grave enough     said mr  jabez wilson     why  i have lost four pound a week         as far as you are personally concerned     remarked holmes     i do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league  on the contrary  you are  as i understand  richer by some        to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter a  you have lost nothing by them         no  sir  but i want to find out about them  and who they are  and what their object was in playing this prank   if it was a prank   upon me  it was a pretty expensive joke for them  for it cost them two and thirty pounds         we shall endeavour to clear up these points for you  and  first  one or two questions  mr  wilson  this assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement   how long had he been with you         about a month then         how did he come         in answer to an advertisement         was he the only applicant         no  i had a dozen         why did you pick him         because he was handy and would come cheap         at half wages  in fact         yes         what is he like  this vincent spaulding         small  stout built  very quick in his ways  no hair on his face  though he   s not short of thirty  has a white splash of acid upon his forehead      holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement     i thought as much     said he     have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings         yes  sir  he told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad         hum     said holmes  sinking back in deep thought     he is still with you         oh  yes  sir  i have only just left him         and has your business been attended to in your absence         nothing to complain of  sir  there   s never very much to do of a morning         that will do  mr  wilson  i shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two  to day is saturday  and i hope that by monday we may come to a conclusion         well  watson     said holmes when our visitor had left us     what do you make of it all         i make nothing of it     i answered frankly     it is a most mysterious business         as a rule     said holmes     the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be  it is your commonplace  featureless crimes which are really puzzling  just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify  but i must be prompt over this matter         what are you going to do  then     i asked      to smoke     he answered     it is quite a three pipe problem  and i beg that you won   t speak to me for fifty minutes     he curled himself up in his chair  with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk like nose  and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird  i had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep  and indeed was nodding myself  when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece      sarasate plays at the st  james   s hall this afternoon     he remarked     what do you think  watson  could your patients spare you for a few hours         i have nothing to do to day  my practice is never very absorbing         then put on your hat and come  i am going through the city first  and we can have some lunch on the way  i observe that there is a good deal of german music on the programme  which is rather more to my taste than italian or french  it is introspective  and i want to introspect  come along      we travelled by the underground as far as aldersgate  and a short walk took us to saxe coburg square  the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning  it was a poky  little  shabby genteel place  where four lines of dingy two storied brick houses looked out into a small railed in enclosure  where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke laden and uncongenial atmosphere  three gilt balls and a brown board with    jabez wilson    in white letters  upon a corner house  announced the place where our red headed client carried on his business  sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over  with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids  then he walked slowly up the street  and then down again to the corner  still looking keenly at the houses  finally he returned to the pawnbroker   s  and  having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times  he went up to the door and knocked  it was instantly opened by a bright looking  clean shaven young fellow  who asked him to step in      thank you     said holmes     i only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the strand         third right  fourth left     answered the assistant promptly  closing the door      smart fellow  that     observed holmes as we walked away     he is  in my judgment  the fourth smartest man in london  and for daring i am not sure that he has not a claim to be third  i have known something of him before         evidently     said i     mr  wilson   s assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the red headed league  i am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him         not him         what then         the knees of his trousers         and what did you see         what i expected to see         why did you beat the pavement         my dear doctor  this is a time for observation  not for talk  we are spies in an enemy   s country  we know something of saxe coburg square  let us now explore the parts which lie behind it      the road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired saxe coburg square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back  it was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the city to the north and west  the roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward  while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians  it was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted      let me see     said holmes  standing at the corner and glancing along the line     i should like just to remember the order of the houses here  it is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of london  there is mortimer   s  the tobacconist  the little newspaper shop  the coburg branch of the city and suburban bank  the vegetarian restaurant  and mcfarlane   s carriage building depot  that carries us right on to the other block  and now  doctor  we   ve done our work  so it   s time we had some play  a sandwich and a cup of coffee  and then off to violin land  where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony  and there are no red headed clients to vex us with their conundrums      my friend was an enthusiastic musician  being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit  all the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness  gently waving his long  thin fingers in time to the music  while his gently smiling face and his languid  dreamy eyes were as unlike those of holmes the sleuth hound  holmes the relentless  keen witted  ready handed criminal agent  as it was possible to conceive  in his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself  and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented  as i have often thought  the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him  the swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy  and  as i knew well  he was never so truly formidable as when  for days on end  he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black letter editions  then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him  and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition  until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals  when i saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at st  james   s hall i felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down      you want to go home  no doubt  doctor     he remarked as we emerged      yes  it would be as well         and i have some business to do which will take some hours  this business at coburg square is serious         why serious         a considerable crime is in contemplation  i have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it  but to day being saturday rather complicates matters  i shall want your help to night         at what time         ten will be early enough         i shall be at baker street at ten         very well  and  i say  doctor  there may be some little danger  so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket     he waved his hand  turned on his heel  and disappeared in an instant among the crowd   i trust that i am not more dense than my neighbours  but i was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with sherlock holmes  here i had heard what he had heard  i had seen what he had seen  and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen  while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque  as i drove home to my house in kensington i thought over it all  from the extraordinary story of the red headed copier of the  encyclop  dia  down to the visit to saxe coburg square  and the ominous words with which he had parted from me  what was this nocturnal expedition  and why should i go armed  where were we going  and what were we to do  i had the hint from holmes that this smooth faced pawnbroker   s assistant was a formidable man   a man who might play a deep game  i tried to puzzle it out  but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation   it was a quarter past nine when i started from home and made my way across the park  and so through oxford street to baker street  two hansoms were standing at the door  and as i entered the passage i heard the sound of voices from above  on entering his room  i found holmes in animated conversation with two men  one of whom i recognised as peter jones  the official police agent  while the other was a long  thin  sad faced man  with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock coat      ha  our party is complete     said holmes  buttoning up his pea jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack     watson  i think you know mr  jones  of scotland yard  let me introduce you to mr  merryweather  who is to be our companion in to night   s adventure         we   re hunting in couples again  doctor  you see     said jones in his consequential way     our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase  all he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down         i hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase     observed mr  merryweather gloomily      you may place considerable confidence in mr  holmes  sir     said the police agent loftily     he has his own little methods  which are  if he won   t mind my saying so  just a little too theoretical and fantastic  but he has the makings of a detective in him  it is not too much to say that once or twice  as in that business of the sholto murder and the agra treasure  he has been more nearly correct than the official force         oh  if you say so  mr  jones  it is all right     said the stranger with deference     still  i confess that i miss my rubber  it is the first saturday night for seven and twenty years that i have not had my rubber         i think you will find     said sherlock holmes     that you will play for a higher stake to night than you have ever done yet  and that the play will be more exciting  for you  mr  merryweather  the stake will be some            and for you  jones  it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands         john clay  the murderer  thief  smasher  and forger  he   s a young man  mr  merryweather  but he is at the head of his profession  and i would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in london  he   s a remarkable man  is young john clay  his grandfather was a royal duke  and he himself has been to eton and oxford  his brain is as cunning as his fingers  and though we meet signs of him at every turn  we never know where to find the man himself  he   ll crack a crib in scotland one week  and be raising money to build an orphanage in cornwall the next  i   ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet         i hope that i may have the pleasure of introducing you to night  i   ve had one or two little turns also with mr  john clay  and i agree with you that he is at the head of his profession  it is past ten  however  and quite time that we started  if you two will take the first hansom  watson and i will follow in the second      sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon  we rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas lit streets until we emerged into farrington street      we are close there now     my friend remarked     this fellow merryweather is a bank director  and personally interested in the matter  i thought it as well to have jones with us also  he is not a bad fellow  though an absolute imbecile in his profession  he has one positive virtue  he is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone  here we are  and they are waiting for us      we had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning  our cabs were dismissed  and  following the guidance of mr  merryweather  we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door  which he opened for us  within there was a small corridor  which ended in a very massive iron gate  this also was opened  and led down a flight of winding stone steps  which terminated at another formidable gate  mr  merryweather stopped to light a lantern  and then conducted us down a dark  earth smelling passage  and so  after opening a third door  into a huge vault or cellar  which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes      you are not very vulnerable from above     holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him      nor from below     said mr  merryweather  striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor     why  dear me  it sounds quite hollow     he remarked  looking up in surprise      i must really ask you to be a little more quiet     said holmes severely     you have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition  might i beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes  and not to interfere      the solemn mr  merryweather perched himself upon a crate  with a very injured expression upon his face  while holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and  with the lantern and a magnifying lens  began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones  a few seconds sufficed to satisfy him  for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket      we have at least an hour before us     he remarked     for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed  then they will not lose a minute  for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape  we are at present  doctor   as no doubt you have divined   in the cellar of the city branch of one of the principal london banks  mr  merryweather is the chairman of directors  and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of london should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present         it is our french gold     whispered the director     we have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it         your french gold         yes  we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose        napoleons from the bank of france  it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money  and that it is still lying in our cellar  the crate upon which i sit contains       napoleons packed between layers of lead foil  our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office  and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject         which were very well justified     observed holmes     and now it is time that we arranged our little plans  i expect that within an hour matters will come to a head  in the meantime mr  merryweather  we must put the screen over that dark lantern         and sit in the dark         i am afraid so  i had brought a pack of cards in my pocket  and i thought that  as we were a  partie carr  e   you might have your rubber after all  but i see that the enemy   s preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light  and  first of all  we must choose our positions  these are daring men  and though we shall take them at a disadvantage  they may do us some harm unless we are careful  i shall stand behind this crate  and do you conceal yourselves behind those  then  when i flash a light upon them  close in swiftly  if they fire  watson  have no compunction about shooting them down      i placed my revolver  cocked  upon the top of the wooden case behind which i crouched  holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness   such an absolute darkness as i have never before experienced  the smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there  ready to flash out at a moment   s notice  to me  with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy  there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom  and in the cold dank air of the vault      they have but one retreat     whispered holmes     that is back through the house into saxe coburg square  i hope that you have done what i asked you  jones         i have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door         then we have stopped all the holes  and now we must be silent and wait      what a time it seemed  from comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter  yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone  and the dawn be breaking above us  my limbs were weary and stiff  for i feared to change my position  yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension  and my hearing was so acute that i could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions  but i could distinguish the deeper  heavier in breath of the bulky jones from the thin  sighing note of the bank director  from my position i could look over the case in the direction of the floor  suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light   at first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement  then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line  and then  without any warning or sound  a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared  a white  almost womanly hand  which felt about in the centre of the little area of light  for a minute or more the hand  with its writhing fingers  protruded out of the floor  then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared  and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones   its disappearance  however  was but momentary  with a rending  tearing sound  one of the broad  white stones turned over upon its side and left a square  gaping hole  through which streamed the light of a lantern  over the edge there peeped a clean cut  boyish face  which looked keenly about it  and then  with a hand on either side of the aperture  drew itself shoulder high and waist high  until one knee rested upon the edge  in another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion  lithe and small like himself  with a pale face and a shock of very red hair      it   s all clear     he whispered     have you the chisel and the bags  great scott  jump  archie  jump  and i   ll swing for it      sherlock holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar  the other dived down the hole  and i heard the sound of rending cloth as jones clutched at his skirts  the light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver  but holmes    hunting crop came down on the man   s wrist  and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor      it   s no use  john clay     said holmes blandly     you have no chance at all         so i see     the other answered with the utmost coolness     i fancy that my pal is all right  though i see you have got his coat tails         there are three men waiting for him at the door     said holmes      oh  indeed  you seem to have done the thing very completely  i must compliment you         and i you     holmes answered     your red headed idea was very new and effective         you   ll see your pal again presently     said jones     he   s quicker at climbing down holes than i am  just hold out while i fix the derbies         i beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands     remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists     you may not be aware that i have royal blood in my veins  have the goodness  also  when you address me always to say    sir    and    please            all right     said jones with a stare and a snigger     well  would you please  sir  march upstairs  where we can get a cab to carry your highness to the police station         that is better     said john clay serenely  he made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective      really  mr  holmes     said mr  merryweather as we followed them from the cellar     i do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you  there is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience         i have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with mr  john clay     said holmes     i have been at some small expense over this matter  which i shall expect the bank to refund  but beyond that i am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique  and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the red headed league         you see  watson     he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in baker street     it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the league  and the copying of the  encyclop  dia   must be to get this not over bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day  it was a curious way of managing it  but  really  it would be difficult to suggest a better  the method was no doubt suggested to clay   s ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice   s hair  the      a week was a lure which must draw him  and what was it to them  who were playing for thousands  they put in the advertisement  one rogue has the temporary office  the other rogue incites the man to apply for it  and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week  from the time that i heard of the assistant having come for half wages  it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation         but how could you guess what the motive was         had there been women in the house  i should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue  that  however  was out of the question  the man   s business was a small one  and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations  and such an expenditure as they were at  it must  then  be something out of the house  what could it be  i thought of the assistant   s fondness for photography  and his trick of vanishing into the cellar  the cellar  there was the end of this tangled clue  then i made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that i had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in london  he was doing something in the cellar   something which took many hours a day for months on end  what could it be  once more  i could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building      so far i had got when we went to visit the scene of action  i surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick  i was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind  it was not in front  then i rang the bell  and  as i hoped  the assistant answered it  we have had some skirmishes  but we had never set eyes upon each other before  i hardly looked at his face  his knees were what i wished to see  you must yourself have remarked how worn  wrinkled  and stained they were  they spoke of those hours of burrowing  the only remaining point was what they were burrowing for  i walked round the corner  saw the city and suburban bank abutted on our friend   s premises  and felt that i had solved my problem  when you drove home after the concert i called upon scotland yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors  with the result that you have seen         and how could you tell that they would make their attempt to night     i asked      well  when they closed their league offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about mr  jabez wilson   s presence   in other words  that they had completed their tunnel  but it was essential that they should use it soon  as it might be discovered  or the bullion might be removed  saturday would suit them better than any other day  as it would give them two days for their escape  for all these reasons i expected them to come to night         you reasoned it out beautifully     i exclaimed in unfeigned admiration     it is so long a chain  and yet every link rings true         it saved me from ennui     he answered  yawning     alas  i already feel it closing in upon me  my life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence  these little problems help me to do so         and you are a benefactor of the race     said i   he shrugged his shoulders     well  perhaps  after all  it is of some little use     he remarked         l   homme c   est rien   l     uvre c   est tout      as gustave flaubert wrote to george sand        iii  a case of identity     my dear fellow     said sherlock holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at baker street     life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent  we would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence  if we could fly out of that window hand in hand  hover over this great city  gently remove the roofs  and peep in at the queer things which are going on  the strange coincidences  the plannings  the cross purposes  the wonderful chains of events  working through generations  and leading to the most  outr    results  it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable         and yet i am not convinced of it     i answered     the cases which come to light in the papers are  as a rule  bald enough  and vulgar enough  we have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits  and yet the result is  it must be confessed  neither fascinating nor artistic         a certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect     remarked holmes     this is wanting in the police report  where more stress is laid  perhaps  upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details  which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter  depend upon it  there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace      i smiled and shook my head     i can quite understand your thinking so     i said     of course  in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled  throughout three continents  you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre  but here      i picked up the morning paper from the ground      let us put it to a practical test  here is the first heading upon which i come     a husband   s cruelty to his wife     there is half a column of print  but i know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me  there is  of course  the other woman  the drink  the push  the blow  the bruise  the sympathetic sister or landlady  the crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude         indeed  your example is an unfortunate one for your argument     said holmes  taking the paper and glancing his eye down it     this is the dundas separation case  and  as it happens  i was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it  the husband was a teetotaler  there was no other woman  and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife  which  you will allow  is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story teller  take a pinch of snuff  doctor  and acknowledge that i have scored over you in your example      he held out his snuffbox of old gold  with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid  its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that i could not help commenting upon it      ah     said he     i forgot that i had not seen you for some weeks  it is a little souvenir from the king of bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the irene adler papers         and the ring     i asked  glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger      it was from the reigning family of holland  though the matter in which i served them was of such delicacy that i cannot confide it even to you  who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems         and have you any on hand just now     i asked with interest      some ten or twelve  but none which present any feature of interest  they are important  you understand  without being interesting  indeed  i have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation  and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation  the larger crimes are apt to be the simpler  for the bigger the crime the more obvious  as a rule  is the motive  in these cases  save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from marseilles  there is nothing which presents any features of interest  it is possible  however  that i may have something better before very many minutes are over  for this is one of my clients  or i am much mistaken      he had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral tinted london street  looking over his shoulder  i saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck  and a large curling red feather in a broad brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish duchess of devonshire fashion over her ear  from under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous  hesitating fashion at our windows  while her body oscillated backward and forward  and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons  suddenly  with a plunge  as of the swimmer who leaves the bank  she hurried across the road  and we heard the sharp clang of the bell      i have seen those symptoms before     said holmes  throwing his cigarette into the fire     oscillation upon the pavement always means an  affaire de c  ur   she would like advice  but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication  and yet even here we may discriminate  when a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates  and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire  here we may take it that there is a love matter  but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed  or grieved  but here she comes in person to resolve our doubts      as he spoke there was a tap at the door  and the boy in buttons entered to announce miss mary sutherland  while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full sailed merchant man behind a tiny pilot boat  sherlock holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable  and  having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair  he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him      do you not find     he said     that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting         i did at first     she answered     but now i know where the letters are without looking     then  suddenly realising the full purport of his words  she gave a violent start and looked up  with fear and astonishment upon her broad  good humoured face     you   ve heard about me  mr  holmes     she cried     else how could you know all that         never mind     said holmes  laughing     it is my business to know things  perhaps i have trained myself to see what others overlook  if not  why should you come to consult me         i came to you  sir  because i heard of you from mrs  etherege  whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead  oh  mr  holmes  i wish you would do as much for me  i   m not rich  but still i have a hundred a year in my own right  besides the little that i make by the machine  and i would give it all to know what has become of mr  hosmer angel         why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry     asked sherlock holmes  with his finger tips together and his eyes to the ceiling   again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of miss mary sutherland     yes  i did bang out of the house     she said     for it made me angry to see the easy way in which mr  windibank   that is  my father   took it all  he would not go to the police  and he would not go to you  and so at last  as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done  it made me mad  and i just on with my things and came right away to you         your father     said holmes     your stepfather  surely  since the name is different         yes  my stepfather  i call him father  though it sounds funny  too  for he is only five years and two months older than myself         and your mother is alive         oh  yes  mother is alive and well  i wasn   t best pleased  mr  holmes  when she married again so soon after father   s death  and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself  father was a plumber in the tottenham court road  and he left a tidy business behind him  which mother carried on with mr  hardy  the foreman  but when mr  windibank came he made her sell the business  for he was very superior  being a traveller in wines  they got         for the goodwill and interest  which wasn   t near as much as father could have got if he had been alive      i had expected to see sherlock holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative  but  on the contrary  he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention      your own little income     he asked     does it come out of the business         oh  no  sir  it is quite separate and was left me by my uncle ned in auckland  it is in new zealand stock  paying     per cent  two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount  but i can only touch the interest         you interest me extremely     said holmes     and since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year  with what you earn into the bargain  you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way  i believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about               i could do with much less than that  mr  holmes  but you understand that as long as i live at home i don   t wish to be a burden to them  and so they have the use of the money just while i am staying with them  of course  that is only just for the time  mr  windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother  and i find that i can do pretty well with what i earn at typewriting  it brings me twopence a sheet  and i can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day         you have made your position very clear to me     said holmes     this is my friend  dr  watson  before whom you can speak as freely as before myself  kindly tell us now all about your connection with mr  hosmer angel      a flush stole over miss sutherland   s face  and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket     i met him first at the gasfitters    ball     she said     they used to send father tickets when he was alive  and then afterwards they remembered us  and sent them to mother  mr  windibank did not wish us to go  he never did wish us to go anywhere  he would get quite mad if i wanted so much as to join a sunday school treat  but this time i was set on going  and i would go  for what right had he to prevent  he said the folk were not fit for us to know  when all father   s friends were to be there  and he said that i had nothing fit to wear  when i had my purple plush that i had never so much as taken out of the drawer  at last  when nothing else would do  he went off to france upon the business of the firm  but we went  mother and i  with mr  hardy  who used to be our foreman  and it was there i met mr  hosmer angel         i suppose     said holmes     that when mr  windibank came back from france he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball         oh  well  he was very good about it  he laughed  i remember  and shrugged his shoulders  and said there was no use denying anything to a woman  for she would have her way         i see  then at the gasfitters    ball you met  as i understand  a gentleman called mr  hosmer angel         yes  sir  i met him that night  and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe  and after that we met him   that is to say  mr  holmes  i met him twice for walks  but after that father came back again  and mr  hosmer angel could not come to the house any more         no         well  you know father didn   t like anything of the sort  he wouldn   t have any visitors if he could help it  and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle  but then  as i used to say to mother  a woman wants her own circle to begin with  and i had not got mine yet         but how about mr  hosmer angel  did he make no attempt to see you         well  father was going off to france again in a week  and hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone  we could write in the meantime  and he used to write every day  i took the letters in in the morning  so there was no need for father to know         were you engaged to the gentleman at this time         oh  yes  mr  holmes  we were engaged after the first walk that we took  hosmer   mr  angel   was a cashier in an office in leadenhall street   and           what office         that   s the worst of it  mr  holmes  i don   t know         where did he live  then         he slept on the premises         and you don   t know his address         no   except that it was leadenhall street         where did you address your letters  then         to the leadenhall street post office  to be left till called for  he said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady  so i offered to typewrite them  like he did his  but he wouldn   t have that  for he said that when i wrote them they seemed to come from me  but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us  that will just show you how fond he was of me  mr  holmes  and the little things that he would think of         it was most suggestive     said holmes     it has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important  can you remember any other little things about mr  hosmer angel         he was a very shy man  mr  holmes  he would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight  for he said that he hated to be conspicuous  very retiring and gentlemanly he was  even his voice was gentle  he   d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young  he told me  and it had left him with a weak throat  and a hesitating  whispering fashion of speech  he was always well dressed  very neat and plain  but his eyes were weak  just as mine are  and he wore tinted glasses against the glare         well  and what happened when mr  windibank  your stepfather  returned to france         mr  hosmer angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back  he was in dreadful earnest and made me swear  with my hands on the testament  that whatever happened i would always be true to him  mother said he was quite right to make me swear  and that it was a sign of his passion  mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than i was  then  when they talked of marrying within the week  i began to ask about father  but they both said never to mind about father  but just to tell him afterwards  and mother said she would make it all right with him  i didn   t quite like that  mr  holmes  it seemed funny that i should ask his leave  as he was only a few years older than me  but i didn   t want to do anything on the sly  so i wrote to father at bordeaux  where the company has its french offices  but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding         it missed him  then         yes  sir  for he had started to england just before it arrived         ha  that was unfortunate  your wedding was arranged  then  for the friday  was it to be in church         yes  sir  but very quietly  it was to be at st  saviour   s  near king   s cross  and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the st  pancras hotel  hosmer came for us in a hansom  but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four wheeler  which happened to be the only other cab in the street  we got to the church first  and when the four wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out  but he never did  and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there  the cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him  for he had seen him get in with his own eyes  that was last friday  mr  holmes  and i have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him         it seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated     said holmes      oh  no  sir  he was too good and kind to leave me so  why  all the morning he was saying to me that  whatever happened  i was to be true  and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us  i was always to remember that i was pledged to him  and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later  it seemed strange talk for a wedding morning  but what has happened since gives a meaning to it         most certainly it does  your own opinion is  then  that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him         yes  sir  i believe that he foresaw some danger  or else he would not have talked so  and then i think that what he foresaw happened         but you have no notion as to what it could have been         none         one more question  how did your mother take the matter         she was angry  and said that i was never to speak of the matter again         and your father  did you tell him         yes  and he seemed to think  with me  that something had happened  and that i should hear of hosmer again  as he said  what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church  and then leaving me  now  if he had borrowed my money  or if he had married me and got my money settled on him  there might be some reason  but hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine  and yet  what could have happened  and why could he not write  oh  it drives me half mad to think of it  and i can   t sleep a wink at night     she pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it      i shall glance into the case for you     said holmes  rising     and i have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result  let the weight of the matter rest upon me now  and do not let your mind dwell upon it further  above all  try to let mr  hosmer angel vanish from your memory  as he has done from your life         then you don   t think i   ll see him again         i fear not         then what has happened to him         you will leave that question in my hands  i should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare         i advertised for him in last saturday   s  chronicle      said she     here is the slip and here are four letters from him         thank you  and your address         no     lyon place  camberwell         mr  angel   s address you never had  i understand  where is your father   s place of business         he travels for westhouse   marbank  the great claret importers of fenchurch street         thank you  you have made your statement very clearly  you will leave the papers here  and remember the advice which i have given you  let the whole incident be a sealed book  and do not allow it to affect your life         you are very kind  mr  holmes  but i cannot do that  i shall be true to hosmer  he shall find me ready when he comes back      for all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face  there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect  she laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way  with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned   sherlock holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together  his legs stretched out in front of him  and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling  then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe  which was to him as a counsellor  and  having lit it  he leaned back in his chair  with the thick blue cloud wreaths spinning up from him  and a look of infinite languor in his face      quite an interesting study  that maiden     he observed     i found her more interesting than her little problem  which  by the way  is rather a trite one  you will find parallel cases  if you consult my index  in andover in        and there was something of the sort at the hague last year  old as is the idea  however  there were one or two details which were new to me  but the maiden herself was most instructive         you appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me     i remarked      not invisible but unnoticed  watson  you did not know where to look  and so you missed all that was important  i can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves  the suggestiveness of thumb nails  or the great issues that may hang from a boot lace  now  what did you gather from that woman   s appearance  describe it         well  she had a slate coloured  broad brimmed straw hat  with a feather of a brickish red  her jacket was black  with black beads sewn upon it  and a fringe of little black jet ornaments  her dress was brown  rather darker than coffee colour  with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves  her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger  her boots i didn   t observe  she had small round  hanging gold earrings  and a general air of being fairly well to do in a vulgar  comfortable  easy going way      sherlock holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled         pon my word  watson  you are coming along wonderfully  you have really done very well indeed  it is true that you have missed everything of importance  but you have hit upon the method  and you have a quick eye for colour  never trust to general impressions  my boy  but concentrate yourself upon details  my first glance is always at a woman   s sleeve  in a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser  as you observe  this woman had plush upon her sleeves  which is a most useful material for showing traces  the double line a little above the wrist  where the typewritist presses against the table  was beautifully defined  the sewing machine  of the hand type  leaves a similar mark  but only on the left arm  and on the side of it farthest from the thumb  instead of being right across the broadest part  as this was  i then glanced at her face  and  observing the dint of a pince nez at either side of her nose  i ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting  which seemed to surprise her         it surprised me         but  surely  it was obvious  i was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that  though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other  they were really odd ones  the one having a slightly decorated toe cap  and the other a plain one  one was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five  and the other at the first  third  and fifth  now  when you see that a young lady  otherwise neatly dressed  has come away from home with odd boots  half buttoned  it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry         and what else     i asked  keenly interested  as i always was  by my friend   s incisive reasoning      i noted  in passing  that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed  you observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger  but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink  she had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep  it must have been this morning  or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger  all this is amusing  though rather elementary  but i must go back to business  watson  would you mind reading me the advertised description of mr  hosmer angel      i held the little printed slip to the light     missing     it said     on the morning of the fourteenth  a gentleman named hosmer angel  about five ft  seven in  in height  strongly built  sallow complexion  black hair  a little bald in the centre  bushy  black side whiskers and moustache  tinted glasses  slight infirmity of speech  was dressed  when last seen  in black frock coat faced with silk  black waistcoat  gold albert chain  and grey harris tweed trousers  with brown gaiters over elastic sided boots  known to have been employed in an office in leadenhall street  anybody bringing      c   c      that will do     said holmes     as to the letters     he continued  glancing over them     they are very commonplace  absolutely no clue in them to mr  angel  save that he quotes balzac once  there is one remarkable point  however  which will no doubt strike you         they are typewritten     i remarked      not only that  but the signature is typewritten  look at the neat little    hosmer angel    at the bottom  there is a date  you see  but no superscription except leadenhall street  which is rather vague  the point about the signature is very suggestive   in fact  we may call it conclusive         of what         my dear fellow  is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case         i cannot say that i do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted         no  that was not the point  however  i shall write two letters  which should settle the matter  one is to a firm in the city  the other is to the young lady   s stepfather  mr  windibank  asking him whether he could meet us here at six o   clock to morrow evening  it is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives  and now  doctor  we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come  so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim      i had had so many reasons to believe in my friend   s subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that i felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom  once only had i known him to fail  in the case of the king of bohemia and of the irene adler photograph  but when i looked back to the weird business of the sign of four  and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the study in scarlet  i felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel   i left him then  still puffing at his black clay pipe  with the conviction that when i came again on the next evening i would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of miss mary sutherland   a professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time  and the whole of next day i was busy at the bedside of the sufferer  it was not until close upon six o   clock that i found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to baker street  half afraid that i might be too late to assist at the  d  nouement  of the little mystery  i found sherlock holmes alone  however  half asleep  with his long  thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair  a formidable array of bottles and test tubes  with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid  told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him      well  have you solved it     i asked as i entered      yes  it was the bisulphate of baryta         no  no  the mystery     i cried      oh  that  i thought of the salt that i have been working upon  there was never any mystery in the matter  though  as i said yesterday  some of the details are of interest  the only drawback is that there is no law  i fear  that can touch the scoundrel         who was he  then  and what was his object in deserting miss sutherland      the question was hardly out of my mouth  and holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply  when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door      this is the girl   s stepfather  mr  james windibank     said holmes     he has written to me to say that he would be here at six  come in      the man who entered was a sturdy  middle sized fellow  some thirty years of age  clean shaven  and sallow skinned  with a bland  insinuating manner  and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes  he shot a questioning glance at each of us  placed his shiny top hat upon the sideboard  and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair      good evening  mr  james windibank     said holmes     i think that this typewritten letter is from you  in which you made an appointment with me for six o   clock         yes  sir  i am afraid that i am a little late  but i am not quite my own master  you know  i am sorry that miss sutherland has troubled you about this little matter  for i think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public  it was quite against my wishes that she came  but she is a very excitable  impulsive girl  as you may have noticed  and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point  of course  i did not mind you so much  as you are not connected with the official police  but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad  besides  it is a useless expense  for how could you possibly find this hosmer angel         on the contrary     said holmes quietly     i have every reason to believe that i will succeed in discovering mr  hosmer angel      mr  windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves     i am delighted to hear it     he said      it is a curious thing     remarked holmes     that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man   s handwriting  unless they are quite new  no two of them write exactly alike  some letters get more worn than others  and some wear only on one side  now  you remark in this note of yours  mr  windibank  that in every case there is some little slurring over of the    e     and a slight defect in the tail of the    r     there are fourteen other characteristics  but those are the more obvious         we do all our correspondence with this machine at the office  and no doubt it is a little worn     our visitor answered  glancing keenly at holmes with his bright little eyes      and now i will show you what is really a very interesting study  mr  windibank     holmes continued     i think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime  it is a subject to which i have devoted some little attention  i have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man  they are all typewritten  in each case  not only are the    e   s    slurred and the    r   s    tailless  but you will observe  if you care to use my magnifying lens  that the fourteen other characteristics to which i have alluded are there as well      mr  windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat     i cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk  mr  holmes     he said     if you can catch the man  catch him  and let me know when you have done it         certainly     said holmes  stepping over and turning the key in the door     i let you know  then  that i have caught him         what  where     shouted mr  windibank  turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap      oh  it won   t do   really it won   t     said holmes suavely     there is no possible getting out of it  mr  windibank  it is quite too transparent  and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question  that   s right  sit down and let us talk it over      our visitor collapsed into a chair  with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow     it   it   s not actionable     he stammered      i am very much afraid that it is not  but between ourselves  windibank  it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me  now  let me just run over the course of events  and you will contradict me if i go wrong      the man sat huddled up in his chair  with his head sunk upon his breast  like one who is utterly crushed  holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and  leaning back with his hands in his pockets  began talking  rather to himself  as it seemed  than to us      the man married a woman very much older than himself for her money     said he     and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them  it was a considerable sum  for people in their position  and the loss of it would have made a serious difference  it was worth an effort to preserve it  the daughter was of a good  amiable disposition  but affectionate and warm hearted in her ways  so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages  and her little income  she would not be allowed to remain single long  now her marriage would mean  of course  the loss of a hundred a year  so what does her stepfather do to prevent it  he takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age  but soon he found that that would not answer forever  she became restive  insisted upon her rights  and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball  what does her clever stepfather do then  he conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart  with the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself  covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses  masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers  sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper  and doubly secure on account of the girl   s short sight  he appears as mr  hosmer angel  and keeps off other lovers by making love himself         it was only a joke at first     groaned our visitor     we never thought that she would have been so carried away         very likely not  however that may be  the young lady was very decidedly carried away  and  having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in france  the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind  she was flattered by the gentleman   s attentions  and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother  then mr  angel began to call  for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced  there were meetings  and an engagement  which would finally secure the girl   s affections from turning towards anyone else  but the deception could not be kept up forever  these pretended journeys to france were rather cumbrous  the thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady   s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come  hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a testament  and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding  james windibank wished miss sutherland to be so bound to hosmer angel  and so uncertain as to his fate  that for ten years to come  at any rate  she would not listen to another man  as far as the church door he brought her  and then  as he could go no farther  he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four wheeler and out at the other  i think that was the chain of events  mr  windibank      our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while holmes had been talking  and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face      it may be so  or it may not  mr  holmes     said he     but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now  and not me  i have done nothing actionable from the first  but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint         the law cannot  as you say  touch you     said holmes  unlocking and throwing open the door     yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more  if the young lady has a brother or a friend  he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders  by jove     he continued  flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man   s face     it is not part of my duties to my client  but here   s a hunting crop handy  and i think i shall just treat myself to       he took two swift steps to the whip  but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs  the heavy hall door banged  and from the window we could see mr  james windibank running at the top of his speed down the road      there   s a cold blooded scoundrel     said holmes  laughing  as he threw himself down into his chair once more     that fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad  and ends on a gallows  the case has  in some respects  been not entirely devoid of interest         i cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning     i remarked      well  of course it was obvious from the first that this mr  hosmer angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct  and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident  as far as we could see  was the stepfather  then the fact that the two men were never together  but that the one always appeared when the other was away  was suggestive  so were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice  which both hinted at a disguise  as did the bushy whiskers  my suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature  which  of course  inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it  you see all these isolated facts  together with many minor ones  all pointed in the same direction         and how did you verify them         having once spotted my man  it was easy to get corroboration  i knew the firm for which this man worked  having taken the printed description  i eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise   the whiskers  the glasses  the voice  and i sent it to the firm  with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers  i had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter  and i wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here  as i expected  his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects  the same post brought me a letter from westhouse   marbank  of fenchurch street  to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employ    james windibank   voil   tout          and miss sutherland         if i tell her she will not believe me  you may remember the old persian saying     there is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub  and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman     there is as much sense in hafiz as in horace  and as much knowledge of the world         iv  the boscombe valley mystery  we were seated at breakfast one morning  my wife and i  when the maid brought in a telegram  it was from sherlock holmes and ran in this way      have you a couple of days to spare  have just been wired for from the west of england in connection with boscombe valley tragedy  shall be glad if you will come with me  air and scenery perfect  leave paddington by the               what do you say  dear     said my wife  looking across at me     will you go         i really don   t know what to say  i have a fairly long list at present         oh  anstruther would do your work for you  you have been looking a little pale lately  i think that the change would do you good  and you are always so interested in mr  sherlock holmes    cases         i should be ungrateful if i were not  seeing what i gained through one of them     i answered     but if i am to go  i must pack at once  for i have only half an hour      my experience of camp life in afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller  my wants were few and simple  so that in less than the time stated i was in a cab with my valise  rattling away to paddington station  sherlock holmes was pacing up and down the platform  his tall  gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling cloak and close fitting cloth cap      it is really very good of you to come  watson     said he     it makes a considerable difference to me  having someone with me on whom i can thoroughly rely  local aid is always either worthless or else biassed  if you will keep the two corner seats i shall get the tickets      we had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which holmes had brought with him  among these he rummaged and read  with intervals of note taking and of meditation  until we were past reading  then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack      have you heard anything of the case     he asked      not a word  i have not seen a paper for some days         the london press has not had very full accounts  i have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars  it seems  from what i gather  to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult         that sounds a little paradoxical         but it is profoundly true  singularity is almost invariably a clue  the more featureless and commonplace a crime is  the more difficult it is to bring it home  in this case  however  they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man         it is a murder  then         well  it is conjectured to be so  i shall take nothing for granted until i have the opportunity of looking personally into it  i will explain the state of things to you  as far as i have been able to understand it  in a very few words      boscombe valley is a country district not very far from ross  in herefordshire  the largest landed proprietor in that part is a mr  john turner  who made his money in australia and returned some years ago to the old country  one of the farms which he held  that of hatherley  was let to mr  charles mccarthy  who was also an ex australian  the men had known each other in the colonies  so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible  turner was apparently the richer man  so mccarthy became his tenant but still remained  it seems  upon terms of perfect equality  as they were frequently together  mccarthy had one son  a lad of eighteen  and turner had an only daughter of the same age  but neither of them had wives living  they appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring english families and to have led retired lives  though both the mccarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race meetings of the neighbourhood  mccarthy kept two servants   a man and a girl  turner had a considerable household  some half dozen at the least  that is as much as i have been able to gather about the families  now for the facts      on june  rd  that is  on monday last  mccarthy left his house at hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the boscombe pool  which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the boscombe valley  he had been out with his serving man in the morning at ross  and he had told the man that he must hurry  as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three  from that appointment he never came back alive      from hatherley farmhouse to the boscombe pool is a quarter of a mile  and two people saw him as he passed over this ground  one was an old woman  whose name is not mentioned  and the other was william crowder  a game keeper in the employ of mr  turner  both these witnesses depose that mr  mccarthy was walking alone  the game keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing mr  mccarthy pass he had seen his son  mr  james mccarthy  going the same way with a gun under his arm  to the best of his belief  the father was actually in sight at the time  and the son was following him  he thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred      the two mccarthys were seen after the time when william crowder  the game keeper  lost sight of them  the boscombe pool is thickly wooded round  with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge  a girl of fourteen  patience moran  who is the daughter of the lodge keeper of the boscombe valley estate  was in one of the woods picking flowers  she states that while she was there she saw  at the border of the wood and close by the lake  mr  mccarthy and his son  and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel  she heard mr  mccarthy the elder using very strong language to his son  and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father  she was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two mccarthys quarrelling near boscombe pool  and that she was afraid that they were going to fight  she had hardly said the words when young mr  mccarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood  and to ask for the help of the lodge keeper  he was much excited  without either his gun or his hat  and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood  on following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool  the head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon  the injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt end of his son   s gun  which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body  under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested  and a verdict of    wilful murder    having been returned at the inquest on tuesday  he was on wednesday brought before the magistrates at ross  who have referred the case to the next assizes  those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police court         i could hardly imagine a more damning case     i remarked     if ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here         circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing     answered holmes thoughtfully     it may seem to point very straight to one thing  but if you shift your own point of view a little  you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different  it must be confessed  however  that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man  and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit  there are several people in the neighbourhood  however  and among them miss turner  the daughter of the neighbouring landowner  who believe in his innocence  and who have retained lestrade  whom you may recollect in connection with the study in scarlet  to work out the case in his interest  lestrade  being rather puzzled  has referred the case to me  and hence it is that two middle aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home         i am afraid     said i     that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case         there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact     he answered  laughing     besides  we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to mr  lestrade  you know me too well to think that i am boasting when i say that i shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing  or even of understanding  to take the first example to hand  i very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right hand side  and yet i question whether mr  lestrade would have noted even so self evident a thing as that         how on earth           my dear fellow  i know you well  i know the military neatness which characterises you  you shave every morning  and in this season you shave by the sunlight  but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side  until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw  it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other  i could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result  i only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference  therein lies my  m  tier   and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us  there are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest  and which are worth considering         what are they         it appears that his arrest did not take place at once  but after the return to hatherley farm  on the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner  he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it  and that it was no more than his deserts  this observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner   s jury         it was a confession     i ejaculated      no  for it was followed by a protestation of innocence         coming on the top of such a damning series of events  it was at least a most suspicious remark         on the contrary     said holmes     it is the brightest rift which i can at present see in the clouds  however innocent he might be  he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him  had he appeared surprised at his own arrest  or feigned indignation at it  i should have looked upon it as highly suspicious  because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances  and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man  his frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man  or else as a man of considerable self restraint and firmness  as to his remark about his deserts  it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father  and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him  and even  according to the little girl whose evidence is so important  to raise his hand as if to strike him  the self reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one      i shook my head     many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence     i remarked      so they have  and many men have been wrongfully hanged         what is the young man   s own account of the matter         it is  i am afraid  not very encouraging to his supporters  though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive  you will find it here  and may read it for yourself      he picked out from his bundle a copy of the local herefordshire paper  and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred  i settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully  it ran in this way      mr  james mccarthy  the only son of the deceased  was then called and gave evidence as follows     i had been away from home for three days at bristol  and had only just returned upon the morning of last monday  the  rd  my father was absent from home at the time of my arrival  and i was informed by the maid that he had driven over to ross with john cobb  the groom  shortly after my return i heard the wheels of his trap in the yard  and  looking out of my window  i saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard  though i was not aware in which direction he was going  i then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the boscombe pool  with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side  on my way i saw william crowder  the game keeper  as he had stated in his evidence  but he is mistaken in thinking that i was following my father  i had no idea that he was in front of me  when about a hundred yards from the pool i heard a cry of    cooee     which was a usual signal between my father and myself  i then hurried forward  and found him standing by the pool  he appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what i was doing there  a conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows  for my father was a man of a very violent temper  seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable  i left him and returned towards hatherley farm  i had not gone more than     yards  however  when i heard a hideous outcry behind me  which caused me to run back again  i found my father expiring upon the ground  with his head terribly injured  i dropped my gun and held him in my arms  but he almost instantly expired  i knelt beside him for some minutes  and then made my way to mr  turner   s lodge keeper  his house being the nearest  to ask for assistance  i saw no one near my father when i returned  and i have no idea how he came by his injuries  he was not a popular man  being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners  but he had  as far as i know  no active enemies  i know nothing further of the matter         the coroner  did your father make any statement to you before he died      witness  he mumbled a few words  but i could only catch some allusion to a rat      the coroner  what did you understand by that      witness  it conveyed no meaning to me  i thought that he was delirious      the coroner  what was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel      witness  i should prefer not to answer      the coroner  i am afraid that i must press it      witness  it is really impossible for me to tell you  i can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed      the coroner  that is for the court to decide  i need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise      witness  i must still refuse      the coroner  i understand that the cry of    cooee    was a common signal between you and your father      witness  it was      the coroner  how was it  then  that he uttered it before he saw you  and before he even knew that you had returned from bristol      witness  with considerable confusion   i do not know      a juryman  did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured      witness  nothing definite      the coroner  what do you mean      witness  i was so disturbed and excited as i rushed out into the open  that i could think of nothing except of my father  yet i have a vague impression that as i ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me  it seemed to me to be something grey in colour  a coat of some sort  or a plaid perhaps  when i rose from my father i looked round for it  but it was gone         do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help            yes  it was gone              you cannot say what it was            no  i had a feeling something was there            how far from the body            a dozen yards or so            and how far from the edge of the wood            about the same            then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it            yes  but with my back towards it         this concluded the examination of the witness         i see     said i as i glanced down the column     that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young mccarthy  he calls attention  and with reason  to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him  also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father  and his singular account of his father   s dying words  they are all  as he remarks  very much against the son      holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat     both you and the coroner have been at some pains     said he     to single out the very strongest points in the young man   s favour  don   t you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little  too little  if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury  too much  if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so  outr    as a dying reference to a rat  and the incident of the vanishing cloth  no  sir  i shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true  and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us  and now here is my pocket petrarch  and not another word shall i say of this case until we are on the scene of action  we lunch at swindon  and i see that we shall be there in twenty minutes      it was nearly four o   clock when we at last  after passing through the beautiful stroud valley  and over the broad gleaming severn  found ourselves at the pretty little country town of ross  a lean  ferret like man  furtive and sly looking  was waiting for us upon the platform  in spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings  i had no difficulty in recognising lestrade  of scotland yard  with him we drove to the hereford arms where a room had already been engaged for us      i have ordered a carriage     said lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea     i knew your energetic nature  and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime         it was very nice and complimentary of you     holmes answered     it is entirely a question of barometric pressure      lestrade looked startled     i do not quite follow     he said      how is the glass  twenty nine  i see  no wind  and not a cloud in the sky  i have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking  and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination  i do not think that it is probable that i shall use the carriage to night      lestrade laughed indulgently     you have  no doubt  already formed your conclusions from the newspapers     he said     the case is as plain as a pikestaff  and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes  still  of course  one can   t refuse a lady  and such a very positive one  too  she has heard of you  and would have your opinion  though i repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which i had not already done  why  bless my soul  here is her carriage at the door      he had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that i have ever seen in my life  her violet eyes shining  her lips parted  a pink flush upon her cheeks  all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern      oh  mr  sherlock holmes     she cried  glancing from one to the other of us  and finally  with a woman   s quick intuition  fastening upon my companion     i am so glad that you have come  i have driven down to tell you so  i know that james didn   t do it  i know it  and i want you to start upon your work knowing it  too  never let yourself doubt upon that point  we have known each other since we were little children  and i know his faults as no one else does  but he is too tender hearted to hurt a fly  such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him         i hope we may clear him  miss turner     said sherlock holmes     you may rely upon my doing all that i can         but you have read the evidence  you have formed some conclusion  do you not see some loophole  some flaw  do you not yourself think that he is innocent         i think that it is very probable         there  now     she cried  throwing back her head and looking defiantly at lestrade     you hear  he gives me hopes      lestrade shrugged his shoulders     i am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions     he said      but he is right  oh  i know that he is right  james never did it  and about his quarrel with his father  i am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because i was concerned in it         in what way     asked holmes      it is no time for me to hide anything  james and his father had many disagreements about me  mr  mccarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us  james and i have always loved each other as brother and sister  but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet  and   and   well  he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet  so there were quarrels  and this  i am sure  was one of them         and your father     asked holmes     was he in favour of such a union         no  he was averse to it also  no one but mr  mccarthy was in favour of it     a quick blush passed over her fresh young face as holmes shot one of his keen  questioning glances at her      thank you for this information     said he     may i see your father if i call to morrow         i am afraid the doctor won   t allow it         the doctor         yes  have you not heard  poor father has never been strong for years back  but this has broken him down completely  he has taken to his bed  and dr  willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered  mr  mccarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in victoria         ha  in victoria  that is important         yes  at the mines         quite so  at the gold mines  where  as i understand  mr  turner made his money         yes  certainly         thank you  miss turner  you have been of material assistance to me         you will tell me if you have any news to morrow  no doubt you will go to the prison to see james  oh  if you do  mr  holmes  do tell him that i know him to be innocent         i will  miss turner         i must go home now  for dad is very ill  and he misses me so if i leave him  good bye  and god help you in your undertaking     she hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered  and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street      i am ashamed of you  holmes     said lestrade with dignity after a few minutes    silence     why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint  i am not over tender of heart  but i call it cruel         i think that i see my way to clearing james mccarthy     said holmes     have you an order to see him in prison         yes  but only for you and me         then i shall reconsider my resolution about going out  we have still time to take a train to hereford and see him to night         ample         then let us do so  watson  i fear that you will find it very slow  but i shall only be away a couple of hours      i walked down to the station with them  and then wandered through the streets of the little town  finally returning to the hotel  where i lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow backed novel  the puny plot of the story was so thin  however  when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping  and i found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact  that i at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day  supposing that this unhappy young man   s story were absolutely true  then what hellish thing  what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father  and the moment when  drawn back by his screams  he rushed into the glade  it was something terrible and deadly  what could it be  might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts  i rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper  which contained a verbatim account of the inquest  in the surgeon   s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon  i marked the spot upon my own head  clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind  that was to some extent in favour of the accused  as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father  still  it did not go for very much  for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell  still  it might be worth while to call holmes    attention to it  then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat  what could that mean  it could not be delirium  a man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious  no  it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate  but what could it indicate  i cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation  and then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young mccarthy  if that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress  presumably his overcoat  in his flight  and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off  what a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was  i did not wonder at lestrade   s opinion  and yet i had so much faith in sherlock holmes    insight that i could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young mccarthy   s innocence   it was late before sherlock holmes returned  he came back alone  for lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town      the glass still keeps very high     he remarked as he sat down     it is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground  on the other hand  a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that  and i did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey  i have seen young mccarthy         and what did you learn from him         nothing         could he throw no light         none at all  i was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her  but i am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else  he is not a very quick witted youth  though comely to look at and  i should think  sound at heart         i cannot admire his taste     i remarked     if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this miss turner         ah  thereby hangs a rather painful tale  this fellow is madly  insanely  in love with her  but some two years ago  when he was only a lad  and before he really knew her  for she had been away five years at a boarding school  what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in bristol and marry her at a registry office  no one knows a word of the matter  but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do  but what he knows to be absolutely impossible  it was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father  at their last interview  was goading him on to propose to miss turner  on the other hand  he had no means of supporting himself  and his father  who was by all accounts a very hard man  would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth  it was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in bristol  and his father did not know where he was  mark that point  it is of importance  good has come out of evil  however  for the barmaid  finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged  has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the bermuda dockyard  so that there is really no tie between them  i think that that bit of news has consoled young mccarthy for all that he has suffered         but if he is innocent  who has done it         ah  who  i would call your attention very particularly to two points  one is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool  and that the someone could not have been his son  for his son was away  and he did not know when he would return  the second is that the murdered man was heard to cry    cooee     before he knew that his son had returned  those are the crucial points upon which the case depends  and now let us talk about george meredith  if you please  and we shall leave all minor matters until to morrow      there was no rain  as holmes had foretold  and the morning broke bright and cloudless  at nine o   clock lestrade called for us with the carriage  and we set off for hatherley farm and the boscombe pool      there is serious news this morning     lestrade observed     it is said that mr  turner  of the hall  is so ill that his life is despaired of         an elderly man  i presume     said holmes      about sixty  but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad  and he has been in failing health for some time  this business has had a very bad effect upon him  he was an old friend of mccarthy   s  and  i may add  a great benefactor to him  for i have learned that he gave him hatherley farm rent free         indeed  that is interesting     said holmes      oh  yes  in a hundred other ways he has helped him  everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him         really  does it not strike you as a little singular that this mccarthy  who appears to have had little of his own  and to have been under such obligations to turner  should still talk of marrying his son to turner   s daughter  who is  presumably  heiress to the estate  and that in such a very cocksure manner  as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow  it is the more strange  since we know that turner himself was averse to the idea  the daughter told us as much  do you not deduce something from that         we have got to the deductions and the inferences     said lestrade  winking at me     i find it hard enough to tackle facts  holmes  without flying away after theories and fancies         you are right     said holmes demurely     you do find it very hard to tackle the facts         anyhow  i have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of     replied lestrade with some warmth      and that is           that mccarthy senior met his death from mccarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine         well  moonshine is a brighter thing than fog     said holmes  laughing     but i am very much mistaken if this is not hatherley farm upon the left         yes  that is it     it was a widespread  comfortable looking building  two storied  slate roofed  with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls  the drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys  however  gave it a stricken look  as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it  we called at the door  when the maid  at holmes    request  showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death  and also a pair of the son   s  though not the pair which he had then had  having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points  holmes desired to be led to the court yard  from which we all followed the winding track which led to boscombe pool   sherlock holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this  men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of baker street would have failed to recognise him  his face flushed and darkened  his brows were drawn into two hard black lines  while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter  his face was bent downward  his shoulders bowed  his lips compressed  and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long  sinewy neck  his nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase  and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears  or  at the most  only provoked a quick  impatient snarl in reply  swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows  and so by way of the woods to the boscombe pool  it was damp  marshy ground  as is all that district  and there were marks of many feet  both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side  sometimes holmes would hurry on  sometimes stop dead  and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow  lestrade and i walked behind him  the detective indifferent and contemptuous  while i watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end   the boscombe pool  which is a little reed girt sheet of water some fifty yards across  is situated at the boundary between the hatherley farm and the private park of the wealthy mr  turner  above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red  jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner   s dwelling  on the hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick  and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake  lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found  and  indeed  so moist was the ground  that i could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man  to holmes  as i could see by his eager face and peering eyes  very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass  he ran round  like a dog who is picking up a scent  and then turned upon my companion      what did you go into the pool for     he asked      i fished about with a rake  i thought there might be some weapon or other trace  but how on earth           oh  tut  tut  i have no time  that left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place  a mole could trace it  and there it vanishes among the reeds  oh  how simple it would all have been had i been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it  here is where the party with the lodge keeper came  and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body  but here are three separate tracks of the same feet     he drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view  talking all the time rather to himself than to us     these are young mccarthy   s feet  twice he was walking  and once he ran swiftly  so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible  that bears out his story  he ran when he saw his father on the ground  then here are the father   s feet as he paced up and down  what is this  then  it is the butt end of the gun as the son stood listening  and this  ha  ha  what have we here  tiptoes  tiptoes  square  too  quite unusual boots  they come  they go  they come again   of course that was for the cloak  now where did they come from     he ran up and down  sometimes losing  sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech  the largest tree in the neighbourhood  holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction  for a long time he remained there  turning over the leaves and dried sticks  gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach  a jagged stone was lying among the moss  and this also he carefully examined and retained  then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad  where all traces were lost      it has been a case of considerable interest     he remarked  returning to his natural manner     i fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge  i think that i will go in and have a word with moran  and perhaps write a little note  having done that  we may drive back to our luncheon  you may walk to the cab  and i shall be with you presently      it was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into ross  holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood      this may interest you  lestrade     he remarked  holding it out     the murder was done with it         i see no marks         there are none         how do you know  then         the grass was growing under it  it had only lain there a few days  there was no sign of a place whence it had been taken  it corresponds with the injuries  there is no sign of any other weapon         and the murderer         is a tall man  left handed  limps with the right leg  wears thick soled shooting boots and a grey cloak  smokes indian cigars  uses a cigar holder  and carries a blunt pen knife in his pocket  there are several other indications  but these may be enough to aid us in our search      lestrade laughed     i am afraid that i am still a sceptic     he said     theories are all very well  but we have to deal with a hard headed british jury          nous verrons      answered holmes calmly     you work your own method  and i shall work mine  i shall be busy this afternoon  and shall probably return to london by the evening train         and leave your case unfinished         no  finished         but the mystery         it is solved         who was the criminal  then         the gentleman i describe         but who is he         surely it would not be difficult to find out  this is not such a populous neighbourhood      lestrade shrugged his shoulders     i am a practical man     he said     and i really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left handed gentleman with a game leg  i should become the laughing stock of scotland yard         all right     said holmes quietly     i have given you the chance  here are your lodgings  good bye  i shall drop you a line before i leave      having left lestrade at his rooms  we drove to our hotel  where we found lunch upon the table  holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face  as one who finds himself in a perplexing position      look here  watson     he said when the cloth was cleared    just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little  i don   t know quite what to do  and i should value your advice  light a cigar and let me expound          pray do so         well  now  in considering this case there are two points about young mccarthy   s narrative which struck us both instantly  although they impressed me in his favour and you against him  one was the fact that his father should  according to his account  cry    cooee     before seeing him  the other was his singular dying reference to a rat  he mumbled several words  you understand  but that was all that caught the son   s ear  now from this double point our research must commence  and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true         what of this    cooee     then         well  obviously it could not have been meant for the son  the son  as far as he knew  was in bristol  it was mere chance that he was within earshot  the    cooee     was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with  but    cooee    is a distinctly australian cry  and one which is used between australians  there is a strong presumption that the person whom mccarthy expected to meet him at boscombe pool was someone who had been in australia         what of the rat  then      sherlock holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table     this is a map of the colony of victoria     he said     i wired to bristol for it last night     he put his hand over part of the map     what do you read         arat     i read      and now     he raised his hand      ballarat         quite so  that was the word the man uttered  and of which his son only caught the last two syllables  he was trying to utter the name of his murderer  so and so  of ballarat         it is wonderful     i exclaimed      it is obvious  and now  you see  i had narrowed the field down considerably  the possession of a grey garment was a third point which  granting the son   s statement to be correct  was a certainty  we have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an australian from ballarat with a grey cloak         certainly         and one who was at home in the district  for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate  where strangers could hardly wander         quite so         then comes our expedition of to day  by an examination of the ground i gained the trifling details which i gave to that imbecile lestrade  as to the personality of the criminal         but how did you gain them         you know my method  it is founded upon the observation of trifles         his height i know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride  his boots  too  might be told from their traces         yes  they were peculiar boots         but his lameness         the impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left  he put less weight upon it  why  because he limped   he was lame         but his left handedness         you were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest  the blow was struck from immediately behind  and yet was upon the left side  now  how can that be unless it were by a left handed man  he had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son  he had even smoked there  i found the ash of a cigar  which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an indian cigar  i have  as you know  devoted some attention to this  and written a little monograph on the ashes of     different varieties of pipe  cigar  and cigarette tobacco  having found the ash  i then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it  it was an indian cigar  of the variety which are rolled in rotterdam         and the cigar holder         i could see that the end had not been in his mouth  therefore he used a holder  the tip had been cut off  not bitten off  but the cut was not a clean one  so i deduced a blunt pen knife         holmes     i said     you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape  and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him  i see the direction in which all this points  the culprit is           mr  john turner     cried the hotel waiter  opening the door of our sitting room  and ushering in a visitor   the man who entered was a strange and impressive figure  his slow  limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude  and yet his hard  deep lined  craggy features  and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character  his tangled beard  grizzled hair  and outstanding  drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance  but his face was of an ashen white  while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue  it was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease      pray sit down on the sofa     said holmes gently     you had my note         yes  the lodge keeper brought it up  you said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal         i thought people would talk if i went to the hall         and why did you wish to see me     he looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes  as though his question was already answered      yes     said holmes  answering the look rather than the words     it is so  i know all about mccarthy      the old man sank his face in his hands     god help me     he cried     but i would not have let the young man come to harm  i give you my word that i would have spoken out if it went against him at the assizes         i am glad to hear you say so     said holmes gravely      i would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl  it would break her heart   it will break her heart when she hears that i am arrested         it may not come to that     said holmes      what         i am no official agent  i understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here  and i am acting in her interests  young mccarthy must be got off  however         i am a dying man     said old turner     i have had diabetes for years  my doctor says it is a question whether i shall live a month  yet i would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol      holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him     just tell us the truth     he said     i shall jot down the facts  you will sign it  and watson here can witness it  then i could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young mccarthy  i promise you that i shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed         it   s as well     said the old man     it   s a question whether i shall live to the assizes  so it matters little to me  but i should wish to spare alice the shock  and now i will make the thing clear to you  it has been a long time in the acting  but will not take me long to tell      you didn   t know this dead man  mccarthy  he was a devil incarnate  i tell you that  god keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he  his grip has been upon me these twenty years  and he has blasted my life  i   ll tell you first how i came to be in his power      it was in the early         s at the diggings  i was a young chap then  hot blooded and reckless  ready to turn my hand at anything  i got among bad companions  took to drink  had no luck with my claim  took to the bush  and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber  there were six of us  and we had a wild  free life of it  sticking up a station from time to time  or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings  black jack of ballarat was the name i went under  and our party is still remembered in the colony as the ballarat gang      one day a gold convoy came down from ballarat to melbourne  and we lay in wait for it and attacked it  there were six troopers and six of us  so it was a close thing  but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley  three of our boys were killed  however  before we got the swag  i put my pistol to the head of the wagon driver  who was this very man mccarthy  i wish to the lord that i had shot him then  but i spared him  though i saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face  as though to remember every feature  we got away with the gold  became wealthy men  and made our way over to england without being suspected  there i parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life  i bought this estate  which chanced to be in the market  and i set myself to do a little good with my money  to make up for the way in which i had earned it  i married  too  and though my wife died young she left me my dear little alice  even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done  in a word  i turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past  all was going well when mccarthy laid his grip upon me      i had gone up to town about an investment  and i met him in regent street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot         here we are  jack     says he  touching me on the arm     we   ll be as good as a family to you  there   s two of us  me and my son  and you can have the keeping of us  if you don   t   it   s a fine  law abiding country is england  and there   s always a policeman within hail         well  down they came to the west country  there was no shaking them off  and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since  there was no rest for me  no peace  no forgetfulness  turn where i would  there was his cunning  grinning face at my elbow  it grew worse as alice grew up  for he soon saw i was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police  whatever he wanted he must have  and whatever it was i gave him without question  land  money  houses  until at last he asked a thing which i could not give  he asked for alice      his son  you see  had grown up  and so had my girl  and as i was known to be in weak health  it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property  but there i was firm  i would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine  not that i had any dislike to the lad  but his blood was in him  and that was enough  i stood firm  mccarthy threatened  i braved him to do his worst  we were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over      when i went down there i found him talking with his son  so i smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone  but as i listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost  he was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets  it drove me mad to think that i and all that i held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this  could i not snap the bond  i was already a dying and a desperate man  though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb  i knew that my own fate was sealed  but my memory and my girl  both could be saved if i could but silence that foul tongue  i did it  mr  holmes  i would do it again  deeply as i have sinned  i have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it  but that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than i could suffer  i struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast  his cry brought back his son  but i had gained the cover of the wood  though i was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which i had dropped in my flight  that is the true story  gentlemen  of all that occurred         well  it is not for me to judge you     said holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out     i pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation         i pray not  sir  and what do you intend to do         in view of your health  nothing  you are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the assizes  i will keep your confession  and if mccarthy is condemned i shall be forced to use it  if not  it shall never be seen by mortal eye  and your secret  whether you be alive or dead  shall be safe with us         farewell  then     said the old man solemnly     your own deathbeds  when they come  will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine     tottering and shaking in all his giant frame  he stumbled slowly from the room      god help us     said holmes after a long silence     why does fate play such tricks with poor  helpless worms  i never hear of such a case as this that i do not think of baxter   s words  and say     there  but for the grace of god  goes sherlock holmes         james mccarthy was acquitted at the assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by holmes and submitted to the defending counsel  old turner lived for seven months after our interview  but he is now dead  and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past     v  the five orange pips  when i glance over my notes and records of the sherlock holmes cases between the years       and        i am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave  some  however  have already gained publicity through the papers  and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree  and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate  some  too  have baffled his analytical skill  and would be  as narratives  beginnings without an ending  while others have been but partially cleared up  and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him  there is  however  one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that i am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been  and probably never will be  entirely cleared up   the year       furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest  of which i retain the records  among my headings under this one twelve months i find an account of the adventure of the paradol chamber  of the amateur mendicant society  who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse  of the facts connected with the loss of the british barque  sophy anderson   of the singular adventures of the grice patersons in the island of uffa  and finally of the camberwell poisoning case  in the latter  as may be remembered  sherlock holmes was able  by winding up the dead man   s watch  to prove that it had been wound up two hours before  and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time   a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case  all these i may sketch out at some future date  but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which i have now taken up my pen to describe   it was in the latter days of september  and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence  all day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows  so that even here in the heart of great  hand made london we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation  like untamed beasts in a cage  as evening drew in  the storm grew higher and louder  and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney  sherlock holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross indexing his records of crime  while i at the other was deep in one of clark russell   s fine sea stories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text  and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves  my wife was on a visit to her mother   s  and for a few days i was a dweller once more in my old quarters at baker street      why     said i  glancing up at my companion     that was surely the bell  who could come to night  some friend of yours  perhaps         except yourself i have none     he answered     i do not encourage visitors         a client  then         if so  it is a serious case  nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour  but i take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady   s      sherlock holmes was wrong in his conjecture  however  for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door  he stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit      come in     said he   the man who entered was young  some two and twenty at the outside  well groomed and trimly clad  with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing  the streaming umbrella which he held in his hand  and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come  he looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp  and i could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy  like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety      i owe you an apology     he said  raising his golden pince nez to his eyes     i trust that i am not intruding  i fear that i have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber         give me your coat and umbrella     said holmes     they may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently  you have come up from the south west  i see         yes  from horsham         that clay and chalk mixture which i see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive         i have come for advice         that is easily got         and help         that is not always so easy         i have heard of you  mr  holmes  i heard from major prendergast how you saved him in the tankerville club scandal         ah  of course  he was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards         he said that you could solve anything         he said too much         that you are never beaten         i have been beaten four times   three times by men  and once by a woman         but what is that compared with the number of your successes         it is true that i have been generally successful         then you may be so with me         i beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case         it is no ordinary one         none of those which come to me are  i am the last court of appeal         and yet i question  sir  whether  in all your experience  you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family         you fill me with interest     said holmes     pray give us the essential facts from the commencement  and i can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important      the young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze      my name     said he     is john openshaw  but my own affairs have  as far as i can understand  little to do with this awful business  it is a hereditary matter  so in order to give you an idea of the facts  i must go back to the commencement of the affair      you must know that my grandfather had two sons   my uncle elias and my father joseph  my father had a small factory at coventry  which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling  he was a patentee of the openshaw unbreakable tire  and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence      my uncle elias emigrated to america when he was a young man and became a planter in florida  where he was reported to have done very well  at the time of the war he fought in jackson   s army  and afterwards under hood  where he rose to be a colonel  when lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation  where he remained for three or four years  about      or      he came back to europe and took a small estate in sussex  near horsham  he had made a very considerable fortune in the states  and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes  and his dislike of the republican policy in extending the franchise to them  he was a singular man  fierce and quick tempered  very foul mouthed when he was angry  and of a most retiring disposition  during all the years that he lived at horsham  i doubt if ever he set foot in the town  he had a garden and two or three fields round his house  and there he would take his exercise  though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room  he drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily  but he would see no society and did not want any friends  not even his own brother      he didn   t mind me  in fact  he took a fancy to me  for at the time when he saw me first i was a youngster of twelve or so  this would be in the year       after he had been eight or nine years in england  he begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way  when he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me  and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople  so that by the time that i was sixteen i was quite master of the house  i kept all the keys and could go where i liked and do what i liked  so long as i did not disturb him in his privacy  there was one singular exception  however  for he had a single room  a lumber room up among the attics  which was invariably locked  and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter  with a boy   s curiosity i have peeped through the keyhole  but i was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room      one day   it was in march         a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel   s plate  it was not a common thing for him to receive letters  for his bills were all paid in ready money  and he had no friends of any sort     from india     said he as he took it up     pondicherry postmark  what can this be     opening it hurriedly  out there jumped five little dried orange pips  which pattered down upon his plate  i began to laugh at this  but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face  his lip had fallen  his eyes were protruding  his skin the colour of putty  and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand     k  k  k      he shrieked  and then     my god  my god  my sins have overtaken me            what is it  uncle     i cried         death     said he  and rising from the table he retired to his room  leaving me palpitating with horror  i took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap  just above the gum  the letter k three times repeated  there was nothing else save the five dried pips  what could be the reason of his overpowering terror  i left the breakfast table  and as i ascended the stair i met him coming down with an old rusty key  which must have belonged to the attic  in one hand  and a small brass box  like a cashbox  in the other         they may do what they like  but i   ll checkmate them still     said he with an oath     tell mary that i shall want a fire in my room to day  and send down to fordham  the horsham lawyer         i did as he ordered  and when the lawyer arrived i was asked to step up to the room  the fire was burning brightly  and in the grate there was a mass of black  fluffy ashes  as of burned paper  while the brass box stood open and empty beside it  as i glanced at the box i noticed  with a start  that upon the lid was printed the treble k which i had read in the morning upon the envelope         i wish you  john     said my uncle     to witness my will  i leave my estate  with all its advantages and all its disadvantages  to my brother  your father  whence it will  no doubt  descend to you  if you can enjoy it in peace  well and good  if you find you cannot  take my advice  my boy  and leave it to your deadliest enemy  i am sorry to give you such a two edged thing  but i can   t say what turn things are going to take  kindly sign the paper where mr  fordham shows you         i signed the paper as directed  and the lawyer took it away with him  the singular incident made  as you may think  the deepest impression upon me  and i pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it  yet i could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind  though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives  i could see a change in my uncle  however  he drank more than ever  and he was less inclined for any sort of society  most of his time he would spend in his room  with the door locked upon the inside  but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand  screaming out that he was afraid of no man  and that he was not to be cooped up  like a sheep in a pen  by man or devil  when these hot fits were over  however  he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him  like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul  at such times i have seen his face  even on a cold day  glisten with moisture  as though it were new raised from a basin      well  to come to an end of the matter  mr  holmes  and not to abuse your patience  there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back  we found him  when we went to search for him  face downward in a little green scummed pool  which lay at the foot of the garden  there was no sign of any violence  and the water was but two feet deep  so that the jury  having regard to his known eccentricity  brought in a verdict of    suicide     but i  who knew how he winced from the very thought of death  had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it  the matter passed  however  and my father entered into possession of the estate  and of some            which lay to his credit at the bank         one moment     holmes interposed     your statement is  i foresee  one of the most remarkable to which i have ever listened  let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter  and the date of his supposed suicide         the letter arrived on march           his death was seven weeks later  upon the night of may  nd         thank you  pray proceed         when my father took over the horsham property  he  at my request  made a careful examination of the attic  which had been always locked up  we found the brass box there  although its contents had been destroyed  on the inside of the cover was a paper label  with the initials of k  k  k  repeated upon it  and    letters  memoranda  receipts  and a register    written beneath  these  we presume  indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by colonel openshaw  for the rest  there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note books bearing upon my uncle   s life in america  some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier  others were of a date during the reconstruction of the southern states  and were mostly concerned with politics  for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet bag politicians who had been sent down from the north      well  it was the beginning of       when my father came to live at horsham  and all went as well as possible with us until the january of        on the fourth day after the new year i heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast table  there he was  sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one  he had always laughed at what he called my cock and bull story about the colonel  but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself         why  what on earth does this mean  john     he stammered      my heart had turned to lead     it is k  k  k      said i      he looked inside the envelope     so it is     he cried     here are the very letters  but what is this written above them            put the papers on the sundial     i read  peeping over his shoulder         what papers  what sundial     he asked         the sundial in the garden  there is no other     said i     but the papers must be those that are destroyed            pooh     said he  gripping hard at his courage     we are in a civilised land here  and we can   t have tomfoolery of this kind  where does the thing come from            from dundee     i answered  glancing at the postmark         some preposterous practical joke     said he     what have i to do with sundials and papers  i shall take no notice of such nonsense            i should certainly speak to the police     i said         and be laughed at for my pains  nothing of the sort            then let me do so            no  i forbid you  i won   t have a fuss made about such nonsense         it was in vain to argue with him  for he was a very obstinate man  i went about  however  with a heart which was full of forebodings      on the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his  major freebody  who is in command of one of the forts upon portsdown hill  i was glad that he should go  for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home  in that  however  i was in error  upon the second day of his absence i received a telegram from the major  imploring me to come at once  my father had fallen over one of the deep chalk pits which abound in the neighbourhood  and was lying senseless  with a shattered skull  i hurried to him  but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness  he had  as it appears  been returning from fareham in the twilight  and as the country was unknown to him  and the chalk pit unfenced  the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of    death from accidental causes     carefully as i examined every fact connected with his death  i was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder  there were no signs of violence  no footmarks  no robbery  no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads  and yet i need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease  and that i was well nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him      in this sinister way i came into my inheritance  you will ask me why i did not dispose of it  i answer  because i was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle   s life  and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another      it was in january         that my poor father met his end  and two years and eight months have elapsed since then  during that time i have lived happily at horsham  and i had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family  and that it had ended with the last generation  i had begun to take comfort too soon  however  yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father      the young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope  and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips      this is the envelope     he continued     the postmark is london   eastern division  within are the very words which were upon my father   s last message     k  k  k      and then    put the papers on the sundial            what have you done     asked holmes      nothing         nothing         to tell the truth      he sank his face into his thin  white hands      i have felt helpless  i have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it  i seem to be in the grasp of some resistless  inexorable evil  which no foresight and no precautions can guard against         tut  tut     cried sherlock holmes     you must act  man  or you are lost  nothing but energy can save you  this is no time for despair         i have seen the police         ah         but they listened to my story with a smile  i am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes  and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents  as the jury stated  and were not to be connected with the warnings      holmes shook his clenched hands in the air     incredible imbecility     he cried      they have  however  allowed me a policeman  who may remain in the house with me         has he come with you to night         no  his orders were to stay in the house      again holmes raved in the air      why did you come to me     he said     and  above all  why did you not come at once         i did not know  it was only to day that i spoke to major prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you         it is really two days since you had the letter  we should have acted before this  you have no further evidence  i suppose  than that which you have placed before us   no suggestive detail which might help us         there is one thing     said john openshaw  he rummaged in his coat pocket  and  drawing out a piece of discoloured  blue tinted paper  he laid it out upon the table     i have some remembrance     said he     that on the day when my uncle burned the papers i observed that the small  unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour  i found this single sheet upon the floor of his room  and i am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has  perhaps  fluttered out from among the others  and in that way has escaped destruction  beyond the mention of pips  i do not see that it helps us much  i think myself that it is a page from some private diary  the writing is undoubtedly my uncle   s      holmes moved the lamp  and we both bent over the sheet of paper  which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book  it was headed     march           and beneath were the following enigmatical notices       th  hudson came  same old platform       th  set the pips on mccauley  paramore  and john swain of st  augustine       th  mccauley cleared        th  john swain cleared        th  visited paramore  all well         thank you     said holmes  folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor     and now you must on no account lose another instant  we cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me  you must get home instantly and act         what shall i do         there is but one thing to do  it must be done at once  you must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described  you must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle  and that this is the only one which remains  you must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them  having done this  you must at once put the box out upon the sundial  as directed  do you understand         entirely         do not think of revenge  or anything of the sort  at present  i think that we may gain that by means of the law  but we have our web to weave  while theirs is already woven  the first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you  the second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties         i thank you     said the young man  rising and pulling on his overcoat     you have given me fresh life and hope  i shall certainly do as you advise         do not lose an instant  and  above all  take care of yourself in the meanwhile  for i do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger  how do you go back         by train from waterloo         it is not yet nine  the streets will be crowded  so i trust that you may be in safety  and yet you cannot guard yourself too closely         i am armed         that is well  to morrow i shall set to work upon your case         i shall see you at horsham  then         no  your secret lies in london  it is there that i shall seek it         then i shall call upon you in a day  or in two days  with news as to the box and the papers  i shall take your advice in every particular     he shook hands with us and took his leave  outside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows  this strange  wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elements   blown in upon us like a sheet of sea weed in a gale   and now to have been reabsorbed by them once more   sherlock holmes sat for some time in silence  with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire  then he lit his pipe  and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling      i think  watson     he remarked at last     that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this         save  perhaps  the sign of four         well  yes  save  perhaps  that  and yet this john openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the sholtos         but have you     i asked     formed any definite conception as to what these perils are         there can be no question as to their nature     he answered      then what are they  who is this k  k  k   and why does he pursue this unhappy family      sherlock holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair  with his finger tips together     the ideal reasoner     he remarked     would  when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings  deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it  as cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone  so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones  both before and after  we have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to  problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses  to carry the art  however  to its highest pitch  it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge  and this in itself implies  as you will readily see  a possession of all knowledge  which  even in these days of free education and encyclop  dias  is a somewhat rare accomplishment  it is not so impossible  however  that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work  and this i have endeavoured in my case to do  if i remember rightly  you on one occasion  in the early days of our friendship  defined my limits in a very precise fashion         yes     i answered  laughing     it was a singular document  philosophy  astronomy  and politics were marked at zero  i remember  botany variable  geology profound as regards the mud stains from any region within fifty miles of town  chemistry eccentric  anatomy unsystematic  sensational literature and crime records unique  violin player  boxer  swordsman  lawyer  and self poisoner by cocaine and tobacco  those  i think  were the main points of my analysis      holmes grinned at the last item     well     he said     i say now  as i said then  that a man should keep his little brain attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use  and the rest he can put away in the lumber room of his library  where he can get it if he wants it  now  for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to night  we need certainly to muster all our resources  kindly hand me down the letter k of the  american encyclop  dia  which stands upon the shelf beside you  thank you  now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it  in the first place  we may start with a strong presumption that colonel openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving america  men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of florida for the lonely life of an english provincial town  his extreme love of solitude in england suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something  so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from america  as to what it was he feared  we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors  did you remark the postmarks of those letters         the first was from pondicherry  the second from dundee  and the third from london         from east london  what do you deduce from that         they are all seaports  that the writer was on board of a ship         excellent  we have already a clue  there can be no doubt that the probability   the strong probability   is that the writer was on board of a ship  and now let us consider another point  in the case of pondicherry  seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment  in dundee it was only some three or four days  does that suggest anything         a greater distance to travel         but the letter had also a greater distance to come         then i do not see the point         there is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing ship  it looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission  you see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from dundee  if they had come from pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter  but  as a matter of fact  seven weeks elapsed  i think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail boat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer         it is possible         more than that  it is probable  and now you see the deadly urgency of this new case  and why i urged young openshaw to caution  the blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance  but this one comes from london  and therefore we cannot count upon delay         good god     i cried     what can it mean  this relentless persecution         the papers which openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing ship  i think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them  a single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner   s jury  there must have been several in it  and they must have been men of resource and determination  their papers they mean to have  be the holder of them who it may  in this way you see k  k  k  ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society         but of what society         have you never       said sherlock holmes  bending forward and sinking his voice      have you never heard of the ku klux klan         i never have      holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee     here it is     said he presently         ku klux klan  a name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle  this terrible secret society was formed by some ex confederate soldiers in the southern states after the civil war  and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country  notably in tennessee  louisiana  the carolinas  georgia  and florida  its power was used for political purposes  principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views  its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape   a sprig of oak leaves in some parts  melon seeds or orange pips in others  on receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways  or might fly from the country  if he braved the matter out  death would unfailingly come upon him  and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner  so perfect was the organisation of the society  and so systematic its methods  that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity  or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators  for some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the united states government and of the better classes of the community in the south  eventually  in the year       the movement rather suddenly collapsed  although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date         you will observe     said holmes  laying down the volume     that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of openshaw from america with their papers  it may well have been cause and effect  it is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track  you can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the south  and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered         then the page we have seen           is such as we might expect  it ran  if i remember right     sent the pips to a  b  and c      that is  sent the society   s warning to them  then there are successive entries that a and b cleared  or left the country  and finally that c was visited  with  i fear  a sinister result for c  well  i think  doctor  that we may let some light into this dark place  and i believe that the only chance young openshaw has in the meantime is to do what i have told him  there is nothing more to be said or to be done to night  so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men      it had cleared in the morning  and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city  sherlock holmes was already at breakfast when i came down      you will excuse me for not waiting for you     said he     i have  i foresee  a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young openshaw   s         what steps will you take     i asked      it will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries  i may have to go down to horsham  after all         you will not go there first         no  i shall commence with the city  just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee      as i waited  i lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it  it rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart      holmes     i cried     you are too late         ah     said he  laying down his cup     i feared as much  how was it done     he spoke calmly  but i could see that he was deeply moved      my eye caught the name of openshaw  and the heading    tragedy near waterloo bridge     here is the account         between nine and ten last night police constable cook  of the h division  on duty near waterloo bridge  heard a cry for help and a splash in the water  the night  however  was extremely dark and stormy  so that  in spite of the help of several passers by  it was quite impossible to effect a rescue  the alarm  however  was given  and  by the aid of the water police  the body was eventually recovered  it proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name  as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket  was john openshaw  and whose residence is near horsham  it is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from waterloo station  and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing places for river steamboats  the body exhibited no traces of violence  and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident  which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing stages         we sat in silence for some minutes  holmes more depressed and shaken than i had ever seen him      that hurts my pride  watson     he said at last     it is a petty feeling  no doubt  but it hurts my pride  it becomes a personal matter with me now  and  if god sends me health  i shall set my hand upon this gang  that he should come to me for help  and that i should send him away to his death        he sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation  with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands      they must be cunning devils     he exclaimed at last     how could they have decoyed him down there  the embankment is not on the direct line to the station  the bridge  no doubt  was too crowded  even on such a night  for their purpose  well  watson  we shall see who will win in the long run  i am going out now         to the police         no  i shall be my own police  when i have spun the web they may take the flies  but not before      all day i was engaged in my professional work  and it was late in the evening before i returned to baker street  sherlock holmes had not come back yet  it was nearly ten o   clock before he entered  looking pale and worn  he walked up to the sideboard  and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously  washing it down with a long draught of water      you are hungry     i remarked      starving  it had escaped my memory  i have had nothing since breakfast         nothing         not a bite  i had no time to think of it         and how have you succeeded         well         you have a clue         i have them in the hollow of my hand  young openshaw shall not long remain unavenged  why  watson  let us put their own devilish trade mark upon them  it is well thought of         what do you mean      he took an orange from the cupboard  and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table  of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope  on the inside of the flap he wrote    s  h  for j  o     then he sealed it and addressed it to    captain james calhoun  barque  lone star   savannah  georgia         that will await him when he enters port     said he  chuckling     it may give him a sleepless night  he will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as openshaw did before him         and who is this captain calhoun         the leader of the gang  i shall have the others  but he first         how did you trace it  then      he took a large sheet of paper from his pocket  all covered with dates and names      i have spent the whole day     said he     over lloyd   s registers and files of the old papers  following the future career of every vessel which touched at pondicherry in january and february in        there were thirty six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months  of these  one  the  lone star   instantly attracted my attention  since  although it was reported as having cleared from london  the name is that which is given to one of the states of the union         texas  i think         i was not and am not sure which  but i knew that the ship must have an american origin         what then         i searched the dundee records  and when i found that the barque  lone star  was there in january         my suspicion became a certainty  i then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of london         yes         the  lone star  had arrived here last week  i went down to the albert dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning  homeward bound to savannah  i wired to gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago  and as the wind is easterly i have no doubt that she is now past the goodwins and not very far from the isle of wight         what will you do  then         oh  i have my hand upon him  he and the two mates  are as i learn  the only native born americans in the ship  the others are finns and germans  i know  also  that they were all three away from the ship last night  i had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo  by the time that their sailing ship reaches savannah the mail boat will have carried this letter  and the cable will have informed the police of savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder      there is ever a flaw  however  in the best laid of human plans  and the murderers of john openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another  as cunning and as resolute as themselves  was upon their track  very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year  we waited long for news of the  lone star  of savannah  but none ever reached us  we did at last hear that somewhere far out in the atlantic a shattered stern post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave  with the letters    l  s     carved upon it  and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the  lone star      vi  the man with the twisted lip  isa whitney  brother of the late elias whitney  d d   principal of the theological college of st  george   s  was much addicted to opium  the habit grew upon him  as i understand  from some foolish freak when he was at college  for having read de quincey   s description of his dreams and sensations  he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects  he found  as so many more have done  that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of  and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug  an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives  i can see him now  with yellow  pasty face  drooping lids  and pin point pupils  all huddled in a chair  the wreck and ruin of a noble man   one night   it was in june          there came a ring to my bell  about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock  i sat up in my chair  and my wife laid her needle work down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment      a patient     said she     you   ll have to go out      i groaned  for i was newly come back from a weary day   we heard the door open  a few hurried words  and then quick steps upon the linoleum  our own door flew open  and a lady  clad in some dark coloured stuff  with a black veil  entered the room      you will excuse my calling so late     she began  and then  suddenly losing her self control  she ran forward  threw her arms about my wife   s neck  and sobbed upon her shoulder     oh  i   m in such trouble     she cried     i do so want a little help         why     said my wife  pulling up her veil     it is kate whitney  how you startled me  kate  i had not an idea who you were when you came in         i didn   t know what to do  so i came straight to you     that was always the way  folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a lighthouse      it was very sweet of you to come  now  you must have some wine and water  and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it  or should you rather that i sent james off to bed         oh  no  no  i want the doctor   s advice and help  too  it   s about isa  he has not been home for two days  i am so frightened about him      it was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband   s trouble  to me as a doctor  to my wife as an old friend and school companion  we soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find  did she know where her husband was  was it possible that we could bring him back to her   it seems that it was  she had the surest information that of late he had  when the fit was on him  made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the city  hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day  and he had come back  twitching and shattered  in the evening  but now the spell had been upon him eight and forty hours  and he lay there  doubtless among the dregs of the docks  breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects  there he was to be found  she was sure of it  at the bar of gold  in upper swandam lane  but what was she to do  how could she  a young and timid woman  make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him   there was the case  and of course there was but one way out of it  might i not escort her to this place  and then  as a second thought  why should she come at all  i was isa whitney   s medical adviser  and as such i had influence over him  i could manage it better if i were alone  i promised her on my word that i would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me  and so in ten minutes i had left my armchair and cheery sitting room behind me  and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand  as it seemed to me at the time  though the future only could show how strange it was to be   but there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure  upper swandam lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of london bridge  between a slop shop and a gin shop  approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave  i found the den of which i was in search  ordering my cab to wait  i passed down the steps  worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet  and by the light of a flickering oil lamp above the door i found the latch and made my way into a long  low room  thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke  and terraced with wooden berths  like the forecastle of an emigrant ship   through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses  bowed shoulders  bent knees  heads thrown back  and chins pointing upward  with here and there a dark  lack lustre eye turned upon the newcomer  out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light  now bright  now faint  as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes  the most lay silent  but some muttered to themselves  and others talked together in a strange  low  monotonous voice  their conversation coming in gushes  and then suddenly tailing off into silence  each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour  at the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal  beside which on a three legged wooden stool there sat a tall  thin old man  with his jaw resting upon his two fists  and his elbows upon his knees  staring into the fire   as i entered  a sallow malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug  beckoning me to an empty berth      thank you  i have not come to stay     said i     there is a friend of mine here  mr  isa whitney  and i wish to speak with him      there was a movement and an exclamation from my right  and peering through the gloom  i saw whitney  pale  haggard  and unkempt  staring out at me      my god  it   s watson     said he  he was in a pitiable state of reaction  with every nerve in a twitter     i say  watson  what o   clock is it         nearly eleven         of what day         of friday  june   th         good heavens  i thought it was wednesday  it is wednesday  what d   you want to frighten a chap for     he sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key      i tell you that it is friday  man  your wife has been waiting this two days for you  you should be ashamed of yourself         so i am  but you   ve got mixed  watson  for i have only been here a few hours  three pipes  four pipes   i forget how many  but i   ll go home with you  i wouldn   t frighten kate   poor little kate  give me your hand  have you a cab         yes  i have one waiting         then i shall go in it  but i must owe something  find what i owe  watson  i am all off colour  i can do nothing for myself      i walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers  holding my breath to keep out the vile  stupefying fumes of the drug  and looking about for the manager  as i passed the tall man who sat by the brazier i felt a sudden pluck at my skirt  and a low voice whispered     walk past me  and then look back at me     the words fell quite distinctly upon my ear  i glanced down  they could only have come from the old man at my side  and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever  very thin  very wrinkled  bent with age  an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees  as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers  i took two steps forward and looked back  it took all my self control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment  he had turned his back so that none could see him but i  his form had filled out  his wrinkles were gone  the dull eyes had regained their fire  and there  sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise  was none other than sherlock holmes  he made a slight motion to me to approach him  and instantly  as he turned his face half round to the company once more  subsided into a doddering  loose lipped senility      holmes     i whispered     what on earth are you doing in this den         as low as you can     he answered     i have excellent ears  if you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours i should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you         i have a cab outside         then pray send him home in it  you may safely trust him  for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief  i should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me  if you will wait outside  i shall be with you in five minutes      it was difficult to refuse any of sherlock holmes    requests  for they were always so exceedingly definite  and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery  i felt  however  that when whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished  and for the rest  i could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence  in a few minutes i had written my note  paid whitney   s bill  led him out to the cab  and seen him driven through the darkness  in a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den  and i was walking down the street with sherlock holmes  for two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot  then  glancing quickly round  he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter      i suppose  watson     said he     that you imagine that i have added opium smoking to cocaine injections  and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views         i was certainly surprised to find you there         but not more so than i to find you         i came to find a friend         and i to find an enemy         an enemy         yes  one of my natural enemies  or  shall i say  my natural prey  briefly  watson  i am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry  and i have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots  as i have done before now  had i been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour   s purchase  for i have used it before now for my own purposes  and the rascally lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me  there is a trap door at the back of that building  near the corner of paul   s wharf  which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights         what  you do not mean bodies         ay  bodies  watson  we should be rich men if we had         for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den  it is the vilest murder trap on the whole riverside  and i fear that neville st  clair has entered it never to leave it more  but our trap should be here     he put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly   a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance  followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses    hoofs      now  watson     said holmes  as a tall dog cart dashed up through the gloom  throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns     you   ll come with me  won   t you         if i can be of use         oh  a trusty comrade is always of use  and a chronicler still more so  my room at the cedars is a double bedded one         the cedars         yes  that is mr  st  clair   s house  i am staying there while i conduct the inquiry         where is it  then         near lee  in kent  we have a seven mile drive before us         but i am all in the dark         of course you are  you   ll know all about it presently  jump up here  all right  john  we shall not need you  here   s half a crown  look out for me to morrow  about eleven  give her her head  so long  then      he flicked the horse with his whip  and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets  which widened gradually  until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge  with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us  beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar  its silence broken only by the heavy  regular footfall of the policeman  or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers  a dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky  and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds  holmes drove in silence  with his head sunk upon his breast  and the air of a man who is lost in thought  while i sat beside him  curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely  and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts  we had driven several miles  and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas  when he shook himself  shrugged his shoulders  and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best      you have a grand gift of silence  watson     said he     it makes you quite invaluable as a companion     pon my word  it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to  for my own thoughts are not over pleasant  i was wondering what i should say to this dear little woman to night when she meets me at the door         you forget that i know nothing about it         i shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to lee  it seems absurdly simple  and yet  somehow i can get nothing to go upon  there   s plenty of thread  no doubt  but i can   t get the end of it into my hand  now  i   ll state the case clearly and concisely to you  watson  and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me         proceed  then         some years ago   to be definite  in may         there came to lee a gentleman  neville st  clair by name  who appeared to have plenty of money  he took a large villa  laid out the grounds very nicely  and lived generally in good style  by degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood  and in      he married the daughter of a local brewer  by whom he now has two children  he had no occupation  but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning  returning by the      from cannon street every night  mr  st  clair is now thirty seven years of age  is a man of temperate habits  a good husband  a very affectionate father  and a man who is popular with all who know him  i may add that his whole debts at the present moment  as far as we have been able to ascertain  amount to          s    while he has        standing to his credit in the capital and counties bank  there is no reason  therefore  to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind      last monday mr  neville st  clair went into town rather earlier than usual  remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform  and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks  now  by the merest chance  his wife received a telegram upon this same monday  very shortly after his departure  to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the aberdeen shipping company  now  if you are well up in your london  you will know that the office of the company is in fresno street  which branches out of upper swandam lane  where you found me to night  mrs  st  clair had her lunch  started for the city  did some shopping  proceeded to the company   s office  got her packet  and found herself at exactly      walking through swandam lane on her way back to the station  have you followed me so far         it is very clear         if you remember  monday was an exceedingly hot day  and mrs  st  clair walked slowly  glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab  as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself  while she was walking in this way down swandam lane  she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry  and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and  as it seemed to her  beckoning to her from a second floor window  the window was open  and she distinctly saw his face  which she describes as being terribly agitated  he waved his hands frantically to her  and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind  one singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat  such as he had started to town in  he had on neither collar nor necktie      convinced that something was amiss with him  she rushed down the steps   for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to night   and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor  at the foot of the stairs  however  she met this lascar scoundrel of whom i have spoken  who thrust her back and  aided by a dane  who acts as assistant there  pushed her out into the street  filled with the most maddening doubts and fears  she rushed down the lane and  by rare good fortune  met in fresno street a number of constables with an inspector  all on their way to their beat  the inspector and two men accompanied her back  and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor  they made their way to the room in which mr  st  clair had last been seen  there was no sign of him there  in fact  in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect  who  it seems  made his home there  both he and the lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon  so determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered  and had almost come to believe that mrs  st  clair had been deluded when  with a cry  she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it  out there fell a cascade of children   s bricks  it was the toy which he had promised to bring home      this discovery  and the evident confusion which the cripple showed  made the inspector realise that the matter was serious  the rooms were carefully examined  and results all pointed to an abominable crime  the front room was plainly furnished as a sitting room and led into a small bedroom  which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves  between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip  which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water  the bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below  on examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill  and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom  thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of mr  neville st  clair  with the exception of his coat  his boots  his socks  his hat  and his watch   all were there  there were no signs of violence upon any of these garments  and there were no other traces of mr  neville st  clair  out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered  and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming  for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy      and now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter  the lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents  but as  by mrs  st  clair   s story  he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband   s appearance at the window  he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime  his defence was one of absolute ignorance  and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of hugh boone  his lodger  and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman   s clothes      so much for the lascar manager  now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den  and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon neville st  clair  his name is hugh boone  and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the city  he is a professional beggar  though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas  some little distance down threadneedle street  upon the left hand side  there is  as you may have remarked  a small angle in the wall  here it is that this creature takes his daily seat  cross legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap  and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him  i have watched the fellow more than once before ever i thought of making his professional acquaintance  and i have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time  his appearance  you see  is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him  a shock of orange hair  a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar  which  by its contraction  has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip  a bulldog chin  and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes  which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair  all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so  too  does his wit  for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers by  this is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den  and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest         but a cripple     said i     what could he have done single handed against a man in the prime of life         he is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp  but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well nurtured man  surely your medical experience would tell you  watson  that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others         pray continue your narrative         mrs  st  clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window  and she was escorted home in a cab by the police  as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations  inspector barton  who had charge of the case  made a very careful examination of the premises  but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter  one mistake had been made in not arresting boone instantly  as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the lascar  but this fault was soon remedied  and he was seized and searched  without anything being found which could incriminate him  there were  it is true  some blood stains upon his right shirt sleeve  but he pointed to his ring finger  which had been cut near the nail  and explained that the bleeding came from there  adding that he had been to the window not long before  and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source  he denied strenuously having ever seen mr  neville st  clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police  as to mrs  st  clair   s assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window  he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming  he was removed  loudly protesting  to the police station  while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue      and it did  though they hardly found upon the mud bank what they had feared to find  it was neville st  clair   s coat  and not neville st  clair  which lay uncovered as the tide receded  and what do you think they found in the pockets         i cannot imagine         no  i don   t think you would guess  every pocket stuffed with pennies and half pennies       pennies and     half pennies  it was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide  but a human body is a different matter  there is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house  it seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river         but i understand that all the other clothes were found in the room  would the body be dressed in a coat alone         no  sir  but the facts might be met speciously enough  suppose that this man boone had thrust neville st  clair through the window  there is no human eye which could have seen the deed  what would he do then  it would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell tale garments  he would seize the coat  then  and be in the act of throwing it out  when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink  he has little time  for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up  and perhaps he has already heard from his lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street  there is not an instant to be lost  he rushes to some secret hoard  where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary  and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat   s sinking  he throws it out  and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below  and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared         it certainly sounds feasible         well  we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better  boone  as i have told you  was arrested and taken to the station  but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him  he had for years been known as a professional beggar  but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one  there the matter stands at present  and the questions which have to be solved   what neville st  clair was doing in the opium den  what happened to him when there  where is he now  and what hugh boone had to do with his disappearance   are all as far from a solution as ever  i confess that i cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties      while sherlock holmes had been detailing this singular series of events  we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind  and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us  just as he finished  however  we drove through two scattered villages  where a few lights still glimmered in the windows      we are on the outskirts of lee     said my companion     we have touched on three english counties in our short drive  starting in middlesex  passing over an angle of surrey  and ending in kent  see that light among the trees  that is the cedars  and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already  i have little doubt  caught the clink of our horse   s feet         but why are you not conducting the case from baker street     i asked      because there are many inquiries which must be made out here  mrs  st  clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal  and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague  i hate to meet her  watson  when i have no news of her husband  here we are  whoa  there  whoa      we had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds  a stable boy had run out to the horse   s head  and springing down  i followed holmes up the small  winding gravel drive which led to the house  as we approached  the door flew open  and a little blonde woman stood in the opening  clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie  with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists  she stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light  one hand upon the door  one half raised in her eagerness  her body slightly bent  her head and face protruded  with eager eyes and parted lips  a standing question      well     she cried     well     and then  seeing that there were two of us  she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders      no good news         none         no bad         no         thank god for that  but come in  you must be weary  for you have had a long day         this is my friend  dr  watson  he has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases  and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation         i am delighted to see you     said she  pressing my hand warmly     you will  i am sure  forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements  when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us         my dear madam     said i     i am an old campaigner  and if i were not i can very well see that no apology is needed  if i can be of any assistance  either to you or to my friend here  i shall be indeed happy         now  mr  sherlock holmes     said the lady as we entered a well lit dining room  upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out     i should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions  to which i beg that you will give a plain answer         certainly  madam         do not trouble about my feelings  i am not hysterical  nor given to fainting  i simply wish to hear your real  real opinion         upon what point         in your heart of hearts  do you think that neville is alive      sherlock holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question     frankly  now     she repeated  standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket chair      frankly  then  madam  i do not         you think that he is dead         i do         murdered         i don   t say that  perhaps         and on what day did he meet his death         on monday         then perhaps  mr  holmes  you will be good enough to explain how it is that i have received a letter from him to day      sherlock holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised      what     he roared      yes  to day     she stood smiling  holding up a little slip of paper in the air      may i see it         certainly      he snatched it from her in his eagerness  and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently  i had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder  the envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day  or rather of the day before  for it was considerably after midnight      coarse writing     murmured holmes     surely this is not your husband   s writing  madam         no  but the enclosure is         i perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address         how can you tell that         the name  you see  is in perfectly black ink  which has dried itself  the rest is of the greyish colour  which shows that blotting paper has been used  if it had been written straight off  and then blotted  none would be of a deep black shade  this man has written the name  and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address  which can only mean that he was not familiar with it  it is  of course  a trifle  but there is nothing so important as trifles  let us now see the letter  ha  there has been an enclosure here         yes  there was a ring  his signet ring         and you are sure that this is your husband   s hand         one of his hands         one         his hand when he wrote hurriedly  it is very unlike his usual writing  and yet i know it well            dearest do not be frightened  all will come well  there is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify  wait in patience    neville     written in pencil upon the fly leaf of a book  octavo size  no water mark  hum  posted to day in gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb  ha  and the flap has been gummed  if i am not very much in error  by a person who had been chewing tobacco  and you have no doubt that it is your husband   s hand  madam         none  neville wrote those words         and they were posted to day at gravesend  well  mrs  st  clair  the clouds lighten  though i should not venture to say that the danger is over         but he must be alive  mr  holmes         unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent  the ring  after all  proves nothing  it may have been taken from him         no  no  it is  it is his very own writing         very well  it may  however  have been written on monday and only posted to day         that is possible         if so  much may have happened between         oh  you must not discourage me  mr  holmes  i know that all is well with him  there is so keen a sympathy between us that i should know if evil came upon him  on the very day that i saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom  and yet i in the dining room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened  do you think that i would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death         i have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner  and in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view  but if your husband is alive and able to write letters  why should he remain away from you         i cannot imagine  it is unthinkable         and on monday he made no remarks before leaving you         no         and you were surprised to see him in swandam lane         very much so         was the window open         yes         then he might have called to you         he might         he only  as i understand  gave an inarticulate cry         yes         a call for help  you thought         yes  he waved his hands         but it might have been a cry of surprise  astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands         it is possible         and you thought he was pulled back         he disappeared so suddenly         he might have leaped back  you did not see anyone else in the room         no  but this horrible man confessed to having been there  and the lascar was at the foot of the stairs         quite so  your husband  as far as you could see  had his ordinary clothes on         but without his collar or tie  i distinctly saw his bare throat         had he ever spoken of swandam lane         never         had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium         never         thank you  mrs  st  clair  those are the principal points about which i wished to be absolutely clear  we shall now have a little supper and then retire  for we may have a very busy day to morrow      a large and comfortable double bedded room had been placed at our disposal  and i was quickly between the sheets  for i was weary after my night of adventure  sherlock holmes was a man  however  who  when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind  would go for days  and even for a week  without rest  turning it over  rearranging his facts  looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient  it was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all night sitting  he took off his coat and waistcoat  put on a large blue dressing gown  and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs  with these he constructed a sort of eastern divan  upon which he perched himself cross legged  with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him  in the dim light of the lamp i saw him sitting there  an old briar pipe between his lips  his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling  the blue smoke curling up from him  silent  motionless  with the light shining upon his strong set aquiline features  so he sat as i dropped off to sleep  and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up  and i found the summer sun shining into the apartment  the pipe was still between his lips  the smoke still curled upward  and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze  but nothing remained of the heap of shag which i had seen upon the previous night      awake  watson     he asked      yes         game for a morning drive         certainly         then dress  no one is stirring yet  but i know where the stable boy sleeps  and we shall soon have the trap out     he chuckled to himself as he spoke  his eyes twinkled  and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night   as i dressed i glanced at my watch  it was no wonder that no one was stirring  it was twenty five minutes past four  i had hardly finished when holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse      i want to test a little theory of mine     said he  pulling on his boots     i think  watson  that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in europe  i deserve to be kicked from here to charing cross  but i think i have the key of the affair now         and where is it     i asked  smiling      in the bathroom     he answered     oh  yes  i am not joking     he continued  seeing my look of incredulity     i have just been there  and i have taken it out  and i have got it in this gladstone bag  come on  my boy  and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock      we made our way downstairs as quietly as possible  and out into the bright morning sunshine  in the road stood our horse and trap  with the half clad stable boy waiting at the head  we both sprang in  and away we dashed down the london road  a few country carts were stirring  bearing in vegetables to the metropolis  but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream      it has been in some points a singular case     said holmes  flicking the horse on into a gallop     i confess that i have been as blind as a mole  but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all      in town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the surrey side  passing down the waterloo bridge road we crossed over the river  and dashing up wellington street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in bow street  sherlock holmes was well known to the force  and the two constables at the door saluted him  one of them held the horse   s head while the other led us in      who is on duty     asked holmes      inspector bradstreet  sir         ah  bradstreet  how are you     a tall  stout official had come down the stone flagged passage  in a peaked cap and frogged jacket     i wish to have a quiet word with you  bradstreet         certainly  mr  holmes  step into my room here      it was a small  office like room  with a huge ledger upon the table  and a telephone projecting from the wall  the inspector sat down at his desk      what can i do for you  mr  holmes         i called about that beggarman  boone   the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of mr  neville st  clair  of lee         yes  he was brought up and remanded for further inquiries         so i heard  you have him here         in the cells         is he quiet         oh  he gives no trouble  but he is a dirty scoundrel         dirty         yes  it is all we can do to make him wash his hands  and his face is as black as a tinker   s  well  when once his case has been settled  he will have a regular prison bath  and i think  if you saw him  you would agree with me that he needed it         i should like to see him very much         would you  that is easily done  come this way  you can leave your bag         no  i think that i   ll take it         very good  come this way  if you please     he led us down a passage  opened a barred door  passed down a winding stair  and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side      the third on the right is his     said the inspector     here it is     he quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through      he is asleep     said he     you can see him very well      we both put our eyes to the grating  the prisoner lay with his face towards us  in a very deep sleep  breathing slowly and heavily  he was a middle sized man  coarsely clad as became his calling  with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat  he was  as the inspector had said  extremely dirty  but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness  a broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin  and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip  so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl  a shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead      he   s a beauty  isn   t he     said the inspector      he certainly needs a wash     remarked holmes     i had an idea that he might  and i took the liberty of bringing the tools with me     he opened the gladstone bag as he spoke  and took out  to my astonishment  a very large bath sponge      he  he  you are a funny one     chuckled the inspector      now  if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly  we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure         well  i don   t know why not     said the inspector     he doesn   t look a credit to the bow street cells  does he     he slipped his key into the lock  and we all very quietly entered the cell  the sleeper half turned  and then settled down once more into a deep slumber  holmes stooped to the water jug  moistened his sponge  and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner   s face      let me introduce you     he shouted     to mr  neville st  clair  of lee  in the county of kent      never in my life have i seen such a sight  the man   s face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree  gone was the coarse brown tint  gone  too  was the horrid scar which had seamed it across  and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face  a twitch brought away the tangled red hair  and there  sitting up in his bed  was a pale  sad faced  refined looking man  black haired and smooth skinned  rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment  then suddenly realising the exposure  he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow      great heavens     cried the inspector     it is  indeed  the missing man  i know him from the photograph      the prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny     be it so     said he     and pray what am i charged with         with making away with mr  neville st     oh  come  you can   t be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it     said the inspector with a grin     well  i have been twenty seven years in the force  but this really takes the cake         if i am mr  neville st  clair  then it is obvious that no crime has been committed  and that  therefore  i am illegally detained         no crime  but a very great error has been committed     said holmes     you would have done better to have trusted your wife         it was not the wife  it was the children     groaned the prisoner     god help me  i would not have them ashamed of their father  my god  what an exposure  what can i do      sherlock holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder      if you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up     said he     of course you can hardly avoid publicity  on the other hand  if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you  i do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers  inspector bradstreet would  i am sure  make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities  the case would then never go into court at all         god bless you     cried the prisoner passionately     i would have endured imprisonment  ay  even execution  rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children      you are the first who have ever heard my story  my father was a schoolmaster in chesterfield  where i received an excellent education  i travelled in my youth  took to the stage  and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in london  one day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis  and i volunteered to supply them  there was the point from which all my adventures started  it was only by trying begging as an amateur that i could get the facts upon which to base my articles  when an actor i had  of course  learned all the secrets of making up  and had been famous in the green room for my skill  i took advantage now of my attainments  i painted my face  and to make myself as pitiable as possible i made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh coloured plaster  then with a red head of hair  and an appropriate dress  i took my station in the business part of the city  ostensibly as a match seller but really as a beggar  for seven hours i plied my trade  and when i returned home in the evening i found to my surprise that i had received no less than    s     d       i wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until  some time later  i backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for        i was at my wit   s end where to get the money  but a sudden idea came to me  i begged a fortnight   s grace from the creditor  asked for a holiday from my employers  and spent the time in begging in the city under my disguise  in ten days i had the money and had paid the debt      well  you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at      a week when i knew that i could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint  laying my cap on the ground  and sitting still  it was a long fight between my pride and the money  but the dollars won at last  and i threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which i had first chosen  inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers  only one man knew my secret  he was the keeper of a low den in which i used to lodge in swandam lane  where i could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a well dressed man about town  this fellow  a lascar  was well paid by me for his rooms  so that i knew that my secret was safe in his possession      well  very soon i found that i was saving considerable sums of money  i do not mean that any beggar in the streets of london could earn        a year   which is less than my average takings   but i had exceptional advantages in my power of making up  and also in a facility of repartee  which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the city  all day a stream of pennies  varied by silver  poured in upon me  and it was a very bad day in which i failed to take           as i grew richer i grew more ambitious  took a house in the country  and eventually married  without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation  my dear wife knew that i had business in the city  she little knew what      last monday i had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when i looked out of my window and saw  to my horror and astonishment  that my wife was standing in the street  with her eyes fixed full upon me  i gave a cry of surprise  threw up my arms to cover my face  and  rushing to my confidant  the lascar  entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me  i heard her voice downstairs  but i knew that she could not ascend  swiftly i threw off my clothes  pulled on those of a beggar  and put on my pigments and wig  even a wife   s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise  but then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room  and that the clothes might betray me  i threw open the window  reopening by my violence a small cut which i had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning  then i seized my coat  which was weighted by the coppers which i had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which i carried my takings  i hurled it out of the window  and it disappeared into the thames  the other clothes would have followed  but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair  and a few minutes after i found  rather  i confess  to my relief  that instead of being identified as mr  neville st  clair  i was arrested as his murderer      i do not know that there is anything else for me to explain  i was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible  and hence my preference for a dirty face  knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious  i slipped off my ring and confided it to the lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me  together with a hurried scrawl  telling her that she had no cause to fear         that note only reached her yesterday     said holmes      good god  what a week she must have spent         the police have watched this lascar     said inspector bradstreet     and i can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved  probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his  who forgot all about it for some days         that was it     said holmes  nodding approvingly     i have no doubt of it  but have you never been prosecuted for begging         many times  but what was a fine to me         it must stop here  however     said bradstreet     if the police are to hush this thing up  there must be no more of hugh boone         i have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take         in that case i think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken  but if you are found again  then all must come out  i am sure  mr  holmes  that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up  i wish i knew how you reach your results         i reached this one     said my friend     by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag  i think  watson  that if we drive to baker street we shall just be in time for breakfast        vii  the adventure of the blue carbuncle  i had called upon my friend sherlock holmes upon the second morning after christmas  with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season  he was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing gown  a pipe rack within his reach upon the right  and a pile of crumpled morning papers  evidently newly studied  near at hand  beside the couch was a wooden chair  and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard felt hat  much the worse for wear  and cracked in several places  a lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination      you are engaged     said i     perhaps i interrupt you         not at all  i am glad to have a friend with whom i can discuss my results  the matter is a perfectly trivial one      he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat      but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction      i seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire  for a sharp frost had set in  and the windows were thick with the ice crystals     i suppose     i remarked     that  homely as it looks  this thing has some deadly story linked on to it   that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime         no  no  no crime     said sherlock holmes  laughing     only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles  amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity  every possible combination of events may be expected to take place  and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal  we have already had experience of such         so much so     i remarked     that of the last six cases which i have added to my notes  three have been entirely free of any legal crime         precisely  you allude to my attempt to recover the irene adler papers  to the singular case of miss mary sutherland  and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip  well  i have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category  you know peterson  the commissionaire         yes         it is to him that this trophy belongs         it is his hat         no  no  he found it  its owner is unknown  i beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem  and  first  as to how it came here  it arrived upon christmas morning  in company with a good fat goose  which is  i have no doubt  roasting at this moment in front of peterson   s fire  the facts are these  about four o   clock on christmas morning  peterson  who  as you know  is a very honest fellow  was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down tottenham court road  in front of him he saw  in the gaslight  a tallish man  walking with a slight stagger  and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder  as he reached the corner of goodge street  a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs  one of the latter knocked off the man   s hat  on which he raised his stick to defend himself and  swinging it over his head  smashed the shop window behind him  peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants  but the man  shocked at having broken the window  and seeing an official looking person in uniform rushing towards him  dropped his goose  took to his heels  and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of tottenham court road  the roughs had also fled at the appearance of peterson  so that he was left in possession of the field of battle  and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable christmas goose         which surely he restored to their owner         my dear fellow  there lies the problem  it is true that    for mrs  henry baker    was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird   s left leg  and it is also true that the initials    h  b     are legible upon the lining of this hat  but as there are some thousands of bakers  and some hundreds of henry bakers in this city of ours  it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them         what  then  did peterson do         he brought round both hat and goose to me on christmas morning  knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me  the goose we retained until this morning  when there were signs that  in spite of the slight frost  it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay  its finder has carried it off  therefore  to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose  while i continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his christmas dinner         did he not advertise         no         then  what clue could you have as to his identity         only as much as we can deduce         from his hat         precisely         but you are joking  what can you gather from this old battered felt         here is my lens  you know my methods  what can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article      i took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully  it was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape  hard and much the worse for wear  the lining had been of red silk  but was a good deal discoloured  there was no maker   s name  but  as holmes had remarked  the initials    h  b     were scrawled upon one side  it was pierced in the brim for a hat securer  but the elastic was missing  for the rest  it was cracked  exceedingly dusty  and spotted in several places  although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink      i can see nothing     said i  handing it back to my friend      on the contrary  watson  you can see everything  you fail  however  to reason from what you see  you are too timid in drawing your inferences         then  pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat      he picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him     it is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been     he remarked     and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct  and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability  that the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it  and also that he was fairly well to do within the last three years  although he has now fallen upon evil days  he had foresight  but has less now than formerly  pointing to a moral retrogression  which  when taken with the decline of his fortunes  seems to indicate some evil influence  probably drink  at work upon him  this may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him         my dear holmes         he has  however  retained some degree of self respect     he continued  disregarding my remonstrance     he is a man who leads a sedentary life  goes out little  is out of training entirely  is middle aged  has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days  and which he anoints with lime cream  these are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat  also  by the way  that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house         you are certainly joking  holmes         not in the least  is it possible that even now  when i give you these results  you are unable to see how they are attained         i have no doubt that i am very stupid  but i must confess that i am unable to follow you  for example  how did you deduce that this man was intellectual      for answer holmes clapped the hat upon his head  it came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose     it is a question of cubic capacity     said he     a man with so large a brain must have something in it         the decline of his fortunes  then         this hat is three years old  these flat brims curled at the edge came in then  it is a hat of the very best quality  look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining  if this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago  and has had no hat since  then he has assuredly gone down in the world         well  that is clear enough  certainly  but how about the foresight and the moral retrogression      sherlock holmes laughed     here is the foresight     said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat securer     they are never sold upon hats  if this man ordered one  it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight  since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind  but since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it  it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly  which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature  on the other hand  he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink  which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self respect         your reasoning is certainly plausible         the further points  that he is middle aged  that his hair is grizzled  that it has been recently cut  and that he uses lime cream  are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining  the lens discloses a large number of hair ends  clean cut by the scissors of the barber  they all appear to be adhesive  and there is a distinct odour of lime cream  this dust  you will observe  is not the gritty  grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house  showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time  while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely  and could therefore  hardly be in the best of training         but his wife   you said that she had ceased to love him         this hat has not been brushed for weeks  when i see you  my dear watson  with a week   s accumulation of dust upon your hat  and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state  i shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife   s affection         but he might be a bachelor         nay  he was bringing home the goose as a peace offering to his wife  remember the card upon the bird   s leg         you have an answer to everything  but how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house         one tallow stain  or even two  might come by chance  but when i see no less than five  i think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow   walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other  anyhow  he never got tallow stains from a gas jet  are you satisfied         well  it is very ingenious     said i  laughing     but since  as you said just now  there has been no crime committed  and no harm done save the loss of a goose  all this seems to be rather a waste of energy      sherlock holmes had opened his mouth to reply  when the door flew open  and peterson  the commissionaire  rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment      the goose  mr  holmes  the goose  sir     he gasped      eh  what of it  then  has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window     holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man   s excited face      see here  sir  see what my wife found in its crop     he held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone  rather smaller than a bean in size  but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand   sherlock holmes sat up with a whistle     by jove  peterson     said he     this is treasure trove indeed  i suppose you know what you have got         a diamond  sir  a precious stone  it cuts into glass as though it were putty         it   s more than a precious stone  it is  the  precious stone         not the countess of morcar   s blue carbuncle     i ejaculated      precisely so  i ought to know its size and shape  seeing that i have read the advertisement about it in  the times  every day lately  it is absolutely unique  and its value can only be conjectured  but the reward offered of         is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price         a thousand pounds  great lord of mercy     the commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us      that is the reward  and i have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem         it was lost  if i remember aright  at the hotel cosmopolitan     i remarked      precisely so  on december   nd  just five days ago  john horner  a plumber  was accused of having abstracted it from the lady   s jewel case  the evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the assizes  i have some account of the matter here  i believe     he rummaged amid his newspapers  glancing over the dates  until at last he smoothed one out  doubled it over  and read the following paragraph      hotel cosmopolitan jewel robbery  john horner      plumber  was brought up upon the charge of having upon the   nd inst   abstracted from the jewel case of the countess of morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle  james ryder  upper attendant at the hotel  gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown horner up to the dressing room of the countess of morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate  which was loose  he had remained with horner some little time  but had finally been called away  on returning  he found that horner had disappeared  that the bureau had been forced open  and that the small morocco casket in which  as it afterwards transpired  the countess was accustomed to keep her jewel  was lying empty upon the dressing table  ryder instantly gave the alarm  and horner was arrested the same evening  but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms  catherine cusack  maid to the countess  deposed to having heard ryder   s cry of dismay on discovering the robbery  and to having rushed into the room  where she found matters as described by the last witness  inspector bradstreet  b division  gave evidence as to the arrest of horner  who struggled frantically  and protested his innocence in the strongest terms  evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner  the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence  but referred it to the assizes  horner  who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings  fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court         hum  so much for the police court     said holmes thoughtfully  tossing aside the paper     the question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel case at one end to the crop of a goose in tottenham court road at the other  you see  watson  our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect  here is the stone  the stone came from the goose  and the goose came from mr  henry baker  the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which i have bored you  so now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery  to do this  we must try the simplest means first  and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers  if this fail  i shall have recourse to other methods         what will you say         give me a pencil and that slip of paper  now  then     found at the corner of goodge street  a goose and a black felt hat  mr  henry baker can have the same by applying at      this evening at    b  baker street     that is clear and concise         very  but will he see it         well  he is sure to keep an eye on the papers  since  to a poor man  the loss was a heavy one  he was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of peterson that he thought of nothing but flight  but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird  then  again  the introduction of his name will cause him to see it  for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it  here you are  peterson  run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers         in which  sir         oh  in the  globe    star    pall mall    st  james   s gazette    evening news    standard    echo   and any others that occur to you         very well  sir  and this stone         ah  yes  i shall keep the stone  thank you  and  i say  peterson  just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me  for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring      when the commissionaire had gone  holmes took up the stone and held it against the light     it   s a bonny thing     said he     just see how it glints and sparkles  of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime  every good stone is  they are the devil   s pet baits  in the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed  this stone is not yet twenty years old  it was found in the banks of the amoy river in southern china and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle  save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red  in spite of its youth  it has already a sinister history  there have been two murders  a vitriol throwing  a suicide  and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty grain weight of crystallised charcoal  who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison  i   ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the countess to say that we have it         do you think that this man horner is innocent         i cannot tell         well  then  do you imagine that this other one  henry baker  had anything to do with the matter         it is  i think  much more likely that henry baker is an absolutely innocent man  who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold  that  however  i shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement         and you can do nothing until then         nothing         in that case i shall continue my professional round  but i shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned  for i should like to see the solution of so tangled a business         very glad to see you  i dine at seven  there is a woodcock  i believe  by the way  in view of recent occurrences  perhaps i ought to ask mrs  hudson to examine its crop      i had been delayed at a case  and it was a little after half past six when i found myself in baker street once more  as i approached the house i saw a tall man in a scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight  just as i arrived the door was opened  and we were shown up together to holmes    room      mr  henry baker  i believe     said he  rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume     pray take this chair by the fire  mr  baker  it is a cold night  and i observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter  ah  watson  you have just come at the right time  is that your hat  mr  baker         yes  sir  that is undoubtedly my hat      he was a large man with rounded shoulders  a massive head  and a broad  intelligent face  sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown  a touch of red in nose and cheeks  with a slight tremor of his extended hand  recalled holmes    surmise as to his habits  his rusty black frock coat was buttoned right up in front  with the collar turned up  and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt  he spoke in a slow staccato fashion  choosing his words with care  and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill usage at the hands of fortune      we have retained these things for some days     said holmes     because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address  i am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise      our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh     shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were     he remarked     i had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird  i did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them         very naturally  by the way  about the bird  we were compelled to eat it         to eat it     our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement      yes  it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so  but i presume that this other goose upon the sideboard  which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh  will answer your purpose equally well         oh  certainly  certainly     answered mr  baker with a sigh of relief      of course  we still have the feathers  legs  crop  and so on of your own bird  so if you wish        the man burst into a hearty laugh     they might be useful to me as relics of my adventure     said he     but beyond that i can hardly see what use the  disjecta membra  of my late acquaintance are going to be to me  no  sir  i think that  with your permission  i will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which i perceive upon the sideboard      sherlock holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders      there is your hat  then  and there your bird     said he     by the way  would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from  i am somewhat of a fowl fancier  and i have seldom seen a better grown goose         certainly  sir     said baker  who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm     there are a few of us who frequent the alpha inn  near the museum   we are to be found in the museum itself during the day  you understand  this year our good host  windigate by name  instituted a goose club  by which  on consideration of some few pence every week  we were each to receive a bird at christmas  my pence were duly paid  and the rest is familiar to you  i am much indebted to you  sir  for a scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity     with a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way      so much for mr  henry baker     said holmes when he had closed the door behind him     it is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter  are you hungry  watson         not particularly         then i suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot         by all means      it was a bitter night  so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats  outside  the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky  and the breath of the passers by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots  our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors    quarter  wimpole street  harley street  and so through wigmore street into oxford street  in a quarter of an hour we were in bloomsbury at the alpha inn  which is a small public house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into holborn  holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy faced  white aproned landlord      your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese     said he      my geese     the man seemed surprised      yes  i was speaking only half an hour ago to mr  henry baker  who was a member of your goose club         ah  yes  i see  but you see  sir  them   s not  our  geese         indeed  whose  then         well  i got the two dozen from a salesman in covent garden         indeed  i know some of them  which was it         breckinridge is his name         ah  i don   t know him  well  here   s your good health landlord  and prosperity to your house  good night         now for mr  breckinridge     he continued  buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air     remember  watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain  we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years    penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence  it is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt  but  in any case  we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police  and which a singular chance has placed in our hands  let us follow it out to the bitter end  faces to the south  then  and quick march      we passed across holborn  down endell street  and so through a zigzag of slums to covent garden market  one of the largest stalls bore the name of breckinridge upon it  and the proprietor a horsey looking man  with a sharp face and trim side whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters      good evening  it   s a cold night     said holmes   the salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion      sold out of geese  i see     continued holmes  pointing at the bare slabs of marble      let you have five hundred to morrow morning         that   s no good         well  there are some on the stall with the gas flare         ah  but i was recommended to you         who by         the landlord of the alpha         oh  yes  i sent him a couple of dozen         fine birds they were  too  now where did you get them from      to my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman      now  then  mister     said he  with his head cocked and his arms akimbo     what are you driving at  let   s have it straight  now         it is straight enough  i should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the alpha         well then  i shan   t tell you  so now         oh  it is a matter of no importance  but i don   t know why you should be so warm over such a trifle         warm  you   d be as warm  maybe  if you were as pestered as i am  when i pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business  but it   s    where are the geese     and    who did you sell the geese to     and    what will you take for the geese     one would think they were the only geese in the world  to hear the fuss that is made over them         well  i have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries     said holmes carelessly     if you won   t tell us the bet is off  that is all  but i   m always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls  and i have a fiver on it that the bird i ate is country bred         well  then  you   ve lost your fiver  for it   s town bred     snapped the salesman      it   s nothing of the kind         i say it is         i don   t believe it         d   you think you know more about fowls than i  who have handled them ever since i was a nipper  i tell you  all those birds that went to the alpha were town bred         you   ll never persuade me to believe that         will you bet  then         it   s merely taking your money  for i know that i am right  but i   ll have a sovereign on with you  just to teach you not to be obstinate      the salesman chuckled grimly     bring me the books  bill     said he   the small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy backed one  laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp      now then  mr  cocksure     said the salesman     i thought that i was out of geese  but before i finish you   ll find that there is still one left in my shop  you see this little book         well         that   s the list of the folk from whom i buy  d   you see  well  then  here on this page are the country folk  and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger  now  then  you see this other page in red ink  well  that is a list of my town suppliers  now  look at that third name  just read it out to me         mrs  oakshott       brixton road           read holmes      quite so  now turn that up in the ledger      holmes turned to the page indicated     here you are     mrs  oakshott       brixton road  egg and poultry supplier            now  then  what   s the last entry            december   nd  twenty four geese at   s     d             quite so  there you are  and underneath            sold to mr  windigate of the alpha  at    s             what have you to say now      sherlock holmes looked deeply chagrined  he drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab  turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words  a few yards off he stopped under a lamp post and laughed in the hearty  noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him      when you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the    pink    un    protruding out of his pocket  you can always draw him by a bet     said he     i daresay that if i had put        down in front of him  that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager  well  watson  we are  i fancy  nearing the end of our quest  and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this mrs  oakshott to night  or whether we should reserve it for to morrow  it is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter  and i should        his remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left  turning round we saw a little rat faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp  while breckinridge  the salesman  framed in the door of his stall  was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure      i   ve had enough of you and your geese     he shouted     i wish you were all at the devil together  if you come pestering me any more with your silly talk i   ll set the dog at you  you bring mrs  oakshott here and i   ll answer her  but what have you to do with it  did i buy the geese off you         no  but one of them was mine all the same     whined the little man      well  then  ask mrs  oakshott for it         she told me to ask you         well  you can ask the king of proosia  for all i care  i   ve had enough of it  get out of this     he rushed fiercely forward  and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness      ha  this may save us a visit to brixton road     whispered holmes     come with me  and we will see what is to be made of this fellow     striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls  my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder  he sprang round  and i could see in the gas light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face      who are you  then  what do you want     he asked in a quavering voice      you will excuse me     said holmes blandly     but i could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now  i think that i could be of assistance to you         you  who are you  how could you know anything of the matter         my name is sherlock holmes  it is my business to know what other people don   t know         but you can know nothing of this         excuse me  i know everything of it  you are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by mrs  oakshott  of brixton road  to a salesman named breckinridge  by him in turn to mr  windigate  of the alpha  and by him to his club  of which mr  henry baker is a member         oh  sir  you are the very man whom i have longed to meet     cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers     i can hardly explain to you how interested i am in this matter      sherlock holmes hailed a four wheeler which was passing     in that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind swept market place     said he     but pray tell me  before we go farther  who it is that i have the pleasure of assisting      the man hesitated for an instant     my name is john robinson     he answered with a sidelong glance      no  no  the real name     said holmes sweetly     it is always awkward doing business with an alias      a flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger     well then     said he     my real name is james ryder         precisely so  head attendant at the hotel cosmopolitan  pray step into the cab  and i shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know      the little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half frightened  half hopeful eyes  as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe  then he stepped into the cab  and in half an hour we were back in the sitting room at baker street  nothing had been said during our drive  but the high  thin breathing of our new companion  and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands  spoke of the nervous tension within him      here we are     said holmes cheerily as we filed into the room     the fire looks very seasonable in this weather  you look cold  mr  ryder  pray take the basket chair  i will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours  now  then  you want to know what became of those geese         yes  sir         or rather  i fancy  of that goose  it was one bird  i imagine in which you were interested   white  with a black bar across the tail      ryder quivered with emotion     oh  sir     he cried     can you tell me where it went to         it came here         here         yes  and a most remarkable bird it proved  i don   t wonder that you should take an interest in it  it laid an egg after it was dead   the bonniest  brightest little blue egg that ever was seen  i have it here in my museum      our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand  holmes unlocked his strong box and held up the blue carbuncle  which shone out like a star  with a cold  brilliant  many pointed radiance  ryder stood glaring with a drawn face  uncertain whether to claim or to disown it      the game   s up  ryder     said holmes quietly     hold up  man  or you   ll be into the fire  give him an arm back into his chair  watson  he   s not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity  give him a dash of brandy  so  now he looks a little more human  what a shrimp it is  to be sure      for a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen  but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks  and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser      i have almost every link in my hands  and all the proofs which i could possibly need  so there is little which you need tell me  still  that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete  you had heard  ryder  of this blue stone of the countess of morcar   s         it was catherine cusack who told me of it     said he in a crackling voice      i see   her ladyship   s waiting maid  well  the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you  as it has been for better men before you  but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used  it seems to me  ryder  that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you  you knew that this man horner  the plumber  had been concerned in some such matter before  and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him  what did you do  then  you made some small job in my lady   s room   you and your confederate cusack   and you managed that he should be the man sent for  then  when he had left  you rifled the jewel case  raised the alarm  and had this unfortunate man arrested  you then        ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion   s knees     for god   s sake  have mercy     he shrieked     think of my father  of my mother  it would break their hearts  i never went wrong before  i never will again  i swear it  i   ll swear it on a bible  oh  don   t bring it into court  for christ   s sake  don   t         get back into your chair     said holmes sternly     it is very well to cringe and crawl now  but you thought little enough of this poor horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing         i will fly  mr  holmes  i will leave the country  sir  then the charge against him will break down         hum  we will talk about that  and now let us hear a true account of the next act  how came the stone into the goose  and how came the goose into the open market  tell us the truth  for there lies your only hope of safety      ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips     i will tell you it just as it happened  sir     said he     when horner had been arrested  it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once  for i did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room  there was no place about the hotel where it would be safe  i went out  as if on some commission  and i made for my sister   s house  she had married a man named oakshott  and lived in brixton road  where she fattened fowls for the market  all the way there every man i met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective  and  for all that it was a cold night  the sweat was pouring down my face before i came to the brixton road  my sister asked me what was the matter  and why i was so pale  but i told her that i had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel  then i went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do      i had a friend once called maudsley  who went to the bad  and has just been serving his time in pentonville  one day he had met me  and fell into talk about the ways of thieves  and how they could get rid of what they stole  i knew that he would be true to me  for i knew one or two things about him  so i made up my mind to go right on to kilburn  where he lived  and take him into my confidence  he would show me how to turn the stone into money  but how to get to him in safety  i thought of the agonies i had gone through in coming from the hotel  i might at any moment be seized and searched  and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket  i was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet  and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how i could beat the best detective that ever lived      my sister had told me some weeks before that i might have the pick of her geese for a christmas present  and i knew that she was always as good as her word  i would take my goose now  and in it i would carry my stone to kilburn  there was a little shed in the yard  and behind this i drove one of the birds   a fine big one  white  with a barred tail  i caught it  and prying its bill open  i thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach  the bird gave a gulp  and i felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop  but the creature flapped and struggled  and out came my sister to know what was the matter  as i turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others         whatever were you doing with that bird  jem     says she         well     said i     you said you   d give me one for christmas  and i was feeling which was the fattest            oh     says she     we   ve set yours aside for you   jem   s bird  we call it  it   s the big white one over yonder  there   s twenty six of them  which makes one for you  and one for us  and two dozen for the market            thank you  maggie     says i     but if it is all the same to you  i   d rather have that one i was handling just now            the other is a good three pound heavier     said she     and we fattened it expressly for you            never mind  i   ll have the other  and i   ll take it now     said i         oh  just as you like     said she  a little huffed     which is it you want  then            that white one with the barred tail  right in the middle of the flock            oh  very well  kill it and take it with you         well  i did what she said  mr  holmes  and i carried the bird all the way to kilburn  i told my pal what i had done  for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to  he laughed until he choked  and we got a knife and opened the goose  my heart turned to water  for there was no sign of the stone  and i knew that some terrible mistake had occurred  i left the bird  rushed back to my sister   s  and hurried into the back yard  there was not a bird to be seen there         where are they all  maggie     i cried         gone to the dealer   s  jem            which dealer   s            breckinridge  of covent garden            but was there another with a barred tail     i asked     the same as the one i chose            yes  jem  there were two barred tailed ones  and i could never tell them apart         well  then  of course i saw it all  and i ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man breckinridge  but he had sold the lot at once  and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone  you heard him yourselves to night  well  he has always answered me like that  my sister thinks that i am going mad  sometimes i think that i am myself  and now   and now i am myself a branded thief  without ever having touched the wealth for which i sold my character  god help me  god help me     he burst into convulsive sobbing  with his face buried in his hands   there was a long silence  broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of sherlock holmes    finger tips upon the edge of the table  then my friend rose and threw open the door      get out     said he      what  sir  oh  heaven bless you         no more words  get out      and no more words were needed  there was a rush  a clatter upon the stairs  the bang of a door  and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street      after all  watson     said holmes  reaching up his hand for his clay pipe     i am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies  if horner were in danger it would be another thing  but this fellow will not appear against him  and the case must collapse  i suppose that i am commuting a felony  but it is just possible that i am saving a soul  this fellow will not go wrong again  he is too terribly frightened  send him to gaol now  and you make him a gaol bird for life  besides  it is the season of forgiveness  chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem  and its solution is its own reward  if you will have the goodness to touch the bell  doctor  we will begin another investigation  in which  also a bird will be the chief feature        viii  the adventure of the speckled band  on glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which i have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend sherlock holmes  i find many tragic  some comic  a large number merely strange  but none commonplace  for  working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth  he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual  and even the fantastic  of all these varied cases  however  i cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well known surrey family of the roylotts of stoke moran  the events in question occurred in the early days of my association with holmes  when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in baker street  it is possible that i might have placed them upon record before  but a promise of secrecy was made at the time  from which i have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given  it is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light  for i have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of dr  grimesby roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth   it was early in april in the year       that i woke one morning to find sherlock holmes standing  fully dressed  by the side of my bed  he was a late riser  as a rule  and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter past seven  i blinked up at him in some surprise  and perhaps just a little resentment  for i was myself regular in my habits      very sorry to knock you up  watson     said he     but it   s the common lot this morning  mrs  hudson has been knocked up  she retorted upon me  and i on you         what is it  then   a fire         no  a client  it seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement  who insists upon seeing me  she is waiting now in the sitting room  now  when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning  and knock sleepy people up out of their beds  i presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate  should it prove to be an interesting case  you would  i am sure  wish to follow it from the outset  i thought  at any rate  that i should call you and give you the chance         my dear fellow  i would not miss it for anything      i had no keener pleasure than in following holmes in his professional investigations  and in admiring the rapid deductions  as swift as intuitions  and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him  i rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting room  a lady dressed in black and heavily veiled  who had been sitting in the window  rose as we entered      good morning  madam     said holmes cheerily     my name is sherlock holmes  this is my intimate friend and associate  dr  watson  before whom you can speak as freely as before myself  ha  i am glad to see that mrs  hudson has had the good sense to light the fire  pray draw up to it  and i shall order you a cup of hot coffee  for i observe that you are shivering         it is not cold which makes me shiver     said the woman in a low voice  changing her seat as requested      what  then         it is fear  mr  holmes  it is terror     she raised her veil as she spoke  and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation  her face all drawn and grey  with restless frightened eyes  like those of some hunted animal  her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty  but her hair was shot with premature grey  and her expression was weary and haggard  sherlock holmes ran her over with one of his quick  all comprehensive glances      you must not fear     said he soothingly  bending forward and patting her forearm     we shall soon set matters right  i have no doubt  you have come in by train this morning  i see         you know me  then         no  but i observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove  you must have started early  and yet you had a good drive in a dog cart  along heavy roads  before you reached the station      the lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion      there is no mystery  my dear madam     said he  smiling     the left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places  the marks are perfectly fresh  there is no vehicle save a dog cart which throws up mud in that way  and then only when you sit on the left hand side of the driver         whatever your reasons may be  you are perfectly correct     said she     i started from home before six  reached leatherhead at twenty past  and came in by the first train to waterloo  sir  i can stand this strain no longer  i shall go mad if it continues  i have no one to turn to   none  save only one  who cares for me  and he  poor fellow  can be of little aid  i have heard of you  mr  holmes  i have heard of you from mrs  farintosh  whom you helped in the hour of her sore need  it was from her that i had your address  oh  sir  do you not think that you could help me  too  and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me  at present it is out of my power to reward you for your services  but in a month or six weeks i shall be married  with the control of my own income  and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful      holmes turned to his desk and  unlocking it  drew out a small case book  which he consulted      farintosh     said he     ah yes  i recall the case  it was concerned with an opal tiara  i think it was before your time  watson  i can only say  madam  that i shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as i did to that of your friend  as to reward  my profession is its own reward  but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses i may be put to  at the time which suits you best  and now i beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter         alas     replied our visitor     the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague  and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points  which might seem trivial to another  that even he to whom of all others i have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that i tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman  he does not say so  but i can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes  but i have heard  mr  holmes  that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart  you may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me         i am all attention  madam         my name is helen stoner  and i am living with my stepfather  who is the last survivor of one of the oldest saxon families in england  the roylotts of stoke moran  on the western border of surrey      holmes nodded his head     the name is familiar to me     said he      the family was at one time among the richest in england  and the estates extended over the borders into berkshire in the north  and hampshire in the west  in the last century  however  four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition  and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the regency  nothing was left save a few acres of ground  and the two hundred year old house  which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage  the last squire dragged out his existence there  living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper  but his only son  my stepfather  seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions  obtained an advance from a relative  which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to calcutta  where  by his professional skill and his force of character  he established a large practice  in a fit of anger  however  caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house  he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence  as it was  he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to england a morose and disappointed man      when dr  roylott was in india he married my mother  mrs  stoner  the young widow of major general stoner  of the bengal artillery  my sister julia and i were twins  and we were only two years old at the time of my mother   s re marriage  she had a considerable sum of money   not less than         a year   and this she bequeathed to dr  roylott entirely while we resided with him  with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage  shortly after our return to england my mother died   she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near crewe  dr  roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in london and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at stoke moran  the money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants  and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness      but a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time  instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours  who had at first been overjoyed to see a roylott of stoke moran back in the old family seat  he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path  violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family  and in my stepfather   s case it had  i believe  been intensified by his long residence in the tropics  a series of disgraceful brawls took place  two of which ended in the police court  until at last he became the terror of the village  and the folks would fly at his approach  for he is a man of immense strength  and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger      last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream  and it was only by paying over all the money which i could gather together that i was able to avert another public exposure  he had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies  and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble covered land which represent the family estate  and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents  wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end  he has a passion also for indian animals  which are sent over to him by a correspondent  and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon  which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master      you can imagine from what i say that my poor sister julia and i had no great pleasure in our lives  no servant would stay with us  and for a long time we did all the work of the house  she was but thirty at the time of her death  and yet her hair had already begun to whiten  even as mine has         your sister is dead  then         she died just two years ago  and it is of her death that i wish to speak to you  you can understand that  living the life which i have described  we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position  we had  however  an aunt  my mother   s maiden sister  miss honoria westphail  who lives near harrow  and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady   s house  julia went there at christmas two years ago  and met there a half pay major of marines  to whom she became engaged  my stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage  but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding  the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion      sherlock holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion  but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor      pray be precise as to details     said he      it is easy for me to be so  for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory  the manor house is  as i have already said  very old  and only one wing is now inhabited  the bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor  the sitting rooms being in the central block of the buildings  of these bedrooms the first is dr  roylott   s  the second my sister   s  and the third my own  there is no communication between them  but they all open out into the same corridor  do i make myself plain         perfectly so         the windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn  that fatal night dr  roylott had gone to his room early  though we knew that he had not retired to rest  for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke  she left her room  therefore  and came into mine  where she sat for some time  chatting about her approaching wedding  at eleven o   clock she rose to leave me  but she paused at the door and looked back         tell me  helen     said she     have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night            never     said i         i suppose that you could not possibly whistle  yourself  in your sleep            certainly not  but why            because during the last few nights i have always  about three in the morning  heard a low  clear whistle  i am a light sleeper  and it has awakened me  i cannot tell where it came from   perhaps from the next room  perhaps from the lawn  i thought that i would just ask you whether you had heard it            no  i have not  it must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation            very likely  and yet if it were on the lawn  i wonder that you did not hear it also            ah  but i sleep more heavily than you            well  it is of no great consequence  at any rate     she smiled back at me  closed my door  and a few moments later i heard her key turn in the lock         indeed     said holmes     was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night         always         and why         i think that i mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon  we had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked         quite so  pray proceed with your statement         i could not sleep that night  a vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me  my sister and i  you will recollect  were twins  and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied  it was a wild night  the wind was howling outside  and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows  suddenly  amid all the hubbub of the gale  there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman  i knew that it was my sister   s voice  i sprang from my bed  wrapped a shawl round me  and rushed into the corridor  as i opened my door i seemed to hear a low whistle  such as my sister described  and a few moments later a clanging sound  as if a mass of metal had fallen  as i ran down the passage  my sister   s door was unlocked  and revolved slowly upon its hinges  i stared at it horror stricken  not knowing what was about to issue from it  by the light of the corridor lamp i saw my sister appear at the opening  her face blanched with terror  her hands groping for help  her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard  i ran to her and threw my arms round her  but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground  she writhed as one who is in terrible pain  and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed  at first i thought that she had not recognised me  but as i bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which i shall never forget     oh  my god  helen  it was the band  the speckled band     there was something else which she would fain have said  and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor   s room  but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words  i rushed out  calling loudly for my stepfather  and i met him hastening from his room in his dressing gown  when he reached my sister   s side she was unconscious  and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village  all efforts were in vain  for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness  such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister         one moment     said holmes     are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound  could you swear to it         that was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry  it is my strong impression that i heard it  and yet  among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house  i may possibly have been deceived         was your sister dressed         no  she was in her night dress  in her right hand was found the charred stump of a match  and in her left a match box         showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place  that is important  and what conclusions did the coroner come to         he investigated the case with great care  for dr  roylott   s conduct had long been notorious in the county  but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death  my evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side  and the windows were blocked by old fashioned shutters with broad iron bars  which were secured every night  the walls were carefully sounded  and were shown to be quite solid all round  and the flooring was also thoroughly examined  with the same result  the chimney is wide  but is barred up by four large staples  it is certain  therefore  that my sister was quite alone when she met her end  besides  there were no marks of any violence upon her         how about poison         the doctors examined her for it  but without success         what do you think that this unfortunate lady died of  then         it is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock  though what it was that frightened her i cannot imagine         were there gipsies in the plantation at the time         yes  there are nearly always some there         ah  and what did you gather from this allusion to a band   a speckled band         sometimes i have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium  sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people  perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation  i do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used      holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied      these are very deep waters     said he     pray go on with your narrative         two years have passed since then  and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever  a month ago  however  a dear friend  whom i have known for many years  has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage  his name is armitage   percy armitage   the second son of mr  armitage  of crane water  near reading  my stepfather has offered no opposition to the match  and we are to be married in the course of the spring  two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building  and my bedroom wall has been pierced  so that i have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died  and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept  imagine  then  my thrill of terror when last night  as i lay awake  thinking over her terrible fate  i suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death  i sprang up and lit the lamp  but nothing was to be seen in the room  i was too shaken to go to bed again  however  so i dressed  and as soon as it was daylight i slipped down  got a dog cart at the crown inn  which is opposite  and drove to leatherhead  from whence i have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice         you have done wisely     said my friend     but have you told me all         yes  all         miss roylott  you have not  you are screening your stepfather         why  what do you mean      for answer holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor   s knee  five little livid spots  the marks of four fingers and a thumb  were printed upon the white wrist      you have been cruelly used     said holmes   the lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist     he is a hard man     she said     and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength      there was a long silence  during which holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire      this is a very deep business     he said at last     there are a thousand details which i should desire to know before i decide upon our course of action  yet we have not a moment to lose  if we were to come to stoke moran to day  would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather         as it happens  he spoke of coming into town to day upon some most important business  it is probable that he will be away all day  and that there would be nothing to disturb you  we have a housekeeper now  but she is old and foolish  and i could easily get her out of the way         excellent  you are not averse to this trip  watson         by no means         then we shall both come  what are you going to do yourself         i have one or two things which i would wish to do now that i am in town  but i shall return by the twelve o   clock train  so as to be there in time for your coming         and you may expect us early in the afternoon  i have myself some small business matters to attend to  will you not wait and breakfast         no  i must go  my heart is lightened already since i have confided my trouble to you  i shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon     she dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room      and what do you think of it all  watson     asked sherlock holmes  leaning back in his chair      it seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business         dark enough and sinister enough         yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound  and that the door  window  and chimney are impassable  then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end         what becomes  then  of these nocturnal whistles  and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman         i cannot think         when you combine the ideas of whistles at night  the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor  the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter   s marriage  the dying allusion to a band  and  finally  the fact that miss helen stoner heard a metallic clang  which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place  i think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines         but what  then  did the gipsies do         i cannot imagine         i see many objections to any such theory         and so do i  it is precisely for that reason that we are going to stoke moran this day  i want to see whether the objections are fatal  or if they may be explained away  but what in the name of the devil      the ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open  and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture  his costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural  having a black top hat  a long frock coat  and a pair of high gaiters  with a hunting crop swinging in his hand  so tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway  and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side  a large face  seared with a thousand wrinkles  burned yellow with the sun  and marked with every evil passion  was turned from one to the other of us  while his deep set  bile shot eyes  and his high  thin  fleshless nose  gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey      which of you is holmes     asked this apparition      my name  sir  but you have the advantage of me     said my companion quietly      i am dr  grimesby roylott  of stoke moran         indeed  doctor     said holmes blandly     pray take a seat         i will do nothing of the kind  my stepdaughter has been here  i have traced her  what has she been saying to you         it is a little cold for the time of the year     said holmes      what has she been saying to you     screamed the old man furiously      but i have heard that the crocuses promise well     continued my companion imperturbably      ha  you put me off  do you     said our new visitor  taking a step forward and shaking his hunting crop     i know you  you scoundrel  i have heard of you before  you are holmes  the meddler      my friend smiled      holmes  the busybody      his smile broadened      holmes  the scotland yard jack in office      holmes chuckled heartily     your conversation is most entertaining     said he     when you go out close the door  for there is a decided draught         i will go when i have had my say  don   t you dare to meddle with my affairs  i know that miss stoner has been here  i traced her  i am a dangerous man to fall foul of  see here     he stepped swiftly forward  seized the poker  and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands      see that you keep yourself out of my grip     he snarled  and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room      he seems a very amiable person     said holmes  laughing     i am not quite so bulky  but if he had remained i might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own     as he spoke he picked up the steel poker and  with a sudden effort  straightened it out again      fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force  this incident gives zest to our investigation  however  and i only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her  and now  watson  we shall order breakfast  and afterwards i shall walk down to doctors    commons  where i hope to get some data which may help us in this matter      it was nearly one o   clock when sherlock holmes returned from his excursion  he held in his hand a sheet of blue paper  scrawled over with notes and figures      i have seen the will of the deceased wife     said he     to determine its exact meaning i have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned  the total income  which at the time of the wife   s death was little short of           is now  through the fall in agricultural prices  not more than         each daughter can claim an income of         in case of marriage  it is evident  therefore  that if both girls had married  this beauty would have had a mere pittance  while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent  my morning   s work has not been wasted  since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort  and now  watson  this is too serious for dawdling  especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs  so if you are ready  we shall call a cab and drive to waterloo  i should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket  an eley   s no    is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots  that and a tooth brush are  i think  all that we need      at waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for leatherhead  where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely surrey lanes  it was a perfect day  with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens  the trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots  and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth  to me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged  my companion sat in the front of the trap  his arms folded  his hat pulled down over his eyes  and his chin sunk upon his breast  buried in the deepest thought  suddenly  however  he started  tapped me on the shoulder  and pointed over the meadows      look there     said he   a heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope  thickening into a grove at the highest point  from amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof tree of a very old mansion      stoke moran     said he      yes  sir  that be the house of dr  grimesby roylott     remarked the driver      there is some building going on there     said holmes     that is where we are going         there   s the village     said the driver  pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left     but if you want to get to the house  you   ll find it shorter to get over this stile  and so by the footpath over the fields  there it is  where the lady is walking         and the lady  i fancy  is miss stoner     observed holmes  shading his eyes     yes  i think we had better do as you suggest      we got off  paid our fare  and the trap rattled back on its way to leatherhead      i thought it as well     said holmes as we climbed the stile     that this fellow should think we had come here as architects  or on some definite business  it may stop his gossip  good afternoon  miss stoner  you see that we have been as good as our word      our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy     i have been waiting so eagerly for you     she cried  shaking hands with us warmly     all has turned out splendidly  dr  roylott has gone to town  and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening         we have had the pleasure of making the doctor   s acquaintance     said holmes  and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred  miss stoner turned white to the lips as she listened      good heavens     she cried     he has followed me  then         so it appears         he is so cunning that i never know when i am safe from him  what will he say when he returns         he must guard himself  for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track  you must lock yourself up from him to night  if he is violent  we shall take you away to your aunt   s at harrow  now  we must make the best use of our time  so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine      the building was of grey  lichen blotched stone  with a high central portion and two curving wings  like the claws of a crab  thrown out on each side  in one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards  while the roof was partly caved in  a picture of ruin  the central portion was in little better repair  but the right hand block was comparatively modern  and the blinds in the windows  with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys  showed that this was where the family resided  some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall  and the stone work had been broken into  but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit  holmes walked slowly up and down the ill trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows      this  i take it  belongs to the room in which you used to sleep  the centre one to your sister   s  and the one next to the main building to dr  roylott   s chamber         exactly so  but i am now sleeping in the middle one         pending the alterations  as i understand  by the way  there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall         there were none  i believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room         ah  that is suggestive  now  on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open  there are windows in it  of course         yes  but very small ones  too narrow for anyone to pass through         as you both locked your doors at night  your rooms were unapproachable from that side  now  would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters      miss stoner did so  and holmes  after a careful examination through the open window  endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open  but without success  there was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar  then with his lens he tested the hinges  but they were of solid iron  built firmly into the massive masonry     hum     said he  scratching his chin in some perplexity     my theory certainly presents some difficulties  no one could pass these shutters if they were bolted  well  we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter      a small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened  holmes refused to examine the third chamber  so we passed at once to the second  that in which miss stoner was now sleeping  and in which her sister had met with her fate  it was a homely little room  with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace  after the fashion of old country houses  a brown chest of drawers stood in one corner  a narrow white counterpaned bed in another  and a dressing table on the left hand side of the window  these articles  with two small wicker work chairs  made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of wilton carpet in the centre  the boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown  worm eaten oak  so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house  holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent  while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down  taking in every detail of the apartment      where does that bell communicate with     he asked at last pointing to a thick bell rope which hung down beside the bed  the tassel actually lying upon the pillow      it goes to the housekeeper   s room         it looks newer than the other things         yes  it was only put there a couple of years ago         your sister asked for it  i suppose         no  i never heard of her using it  we used always to get what we wanted for ourselves         indeed  it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell pull there  you will excuse me for a few minutes while i satisfy myself as to this floor     he threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward  examining minutely the cracks between the boards  then he did the same with the wood work with which the chamber was panelled  finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall  finally he took the bell rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug      why  it   s a dummy     said he      won   t it ring         no  it is not even attached to a wire  this is very interesting  you can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is         how very absurd  i never noticed that before         very strange     muttered holmes  pulling at the rope     there are one or two very singular points about this room  for example  what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room  when  with the same trouble  he might have communicated with the outside air         that is also quite modern     said the lady      done about the same time as the bell rope     remarked holmes      yes  there were several little changes carried out about that time         they seem to have been of a most interesting character   dummy bell ropes  and ventilators which do not ventilate  with your permission  miss stoner  we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment      dr  grimesby roylott   s chamber was larger than that of his step daughter  but was as plainly furnished  a camp bed  a small wooden shelf full of books  mostly of a technical character  an armchair beside the bed  a plain wooden chair against the wall  a round table  and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye  holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest      what   s in here     he asked  tapping the safe      my stepfather   s business papers         oh  you have seen inside  then         only once  some years ago  i remember that it was full of papers         there isn   t a cat in it  for example         no  what a strange idea         well  look at this     he took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it      no  we don   t keep a cat  but there is a cheetah and a baboon         ah  yes  of course  well  a cheetah is just a big cat  and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants  i daresay  there is one point which i should wish to determine     he squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention      thank you  that is quite settled     said he  rising and putting his lens in his pocket     hullo  here is something interesting      the object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed  the lash  however  was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord      what do you make of that  watson         it   s a common enough lash  but i don   t know why it should be tied         that is not quite so common  is it  ah  me  it   s a wicked world  and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all  i think that i have seen enough now  miss stoner  and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn      i had never seen my friend   s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation  we had walked several times up and down the lawn  neither miss stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie      it is very essential  miss stoner     said he     that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect         i shall most certainly do so         the matter is too serious for any hesitation  your life may depend upon your compliance         i assure you that i am in your hands         in the first place  both my friend and i must spend the night in your room      both miss stoner and i gazed at him in astonishment      yes  it must be so  let me explain  i believe that that is the village inn over there         yes  that is the crown         very good  your windows would be visible from there         certainly         you must confine yourself to your room  on pretence of a headache  when your stepfather comes back  then when you hear him retire for the night  you must open the shutters of your window  undo the hasp  put your lamp there as a signal to us  and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy  i have no doubt that  in spite of the repairs  you could manage there for one night         oh  yes  easily         the rest you will leave in our hands         but what will you do         we shall spend the night in your room  and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you         i believe  mr  holmes  that you have already made up your mind     said miss stoner  laying her hand upon my companion   s sleeve      perhaps i have         then  for pity   s sake  tell me what was the cause of my sister   s death         i should prefer to have clearer proofs before i speak         you can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct  and if she died from some sudden fright         no  i do not think so  i think that there was probably some more tangible cause  and now  miss stoner  we must leave you for if dr  roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain  good bye  and be brave  for if you will do what i have told you  you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you      sherlock holmes and i had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting room at the crown inn  they were on the upper floor  and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate  and of the inhabited wing of stoke moran manor house  at dusk we saw dr  grimesby roylott drive past  his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him  the boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates  and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor   s voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him  the trap drove on  and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting rooms      do you know  watson     said holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness     i have really some scruples as to taking you to night  there is a distinct element of danger         can i be of assistance         your presence might be invaluable         then i shall certainly come         it is very kind of you         you speak of danger  you have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me         no  but i fancy that i may have deduced a little more  i imagine that you saw all that i did         i saw nothing remarkable save the bell rope  and what purpose that could answer i confess is more than i can imagine         you saw the ventilator  too         yes  but i do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms  it was so small that a rat could hardly pass through         i knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to stoke moran         my dear holmes         oh  yes  i did  you remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell dr  roylott   s cigar  now  of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms  it could only be a small one  or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner   s inquiry  i deduced a ventilator         but what harm can there be in that         well  there is at least a curious coincidence of dates  a ventilator is made  a cord is hung  and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies  does not that strike you         i cannot as yet see any connection         did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed         no         it was clamped to the floor  did you ever see a bed fastened like that before         i cannot say that i have         the lady could not move her bed  it must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope   or so we may call it  since it was clearly never meant for a bell pull         holmes     i cried     i seem to see dimly what you are hinting at  we are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime         subtle enough and horrible enough  when a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals  he has nerve and he has knowledge  palmer and pritchard were among the heads of their profession  this man strikes even deeper  but i think  watson  that we shall be able to strike deeper still  but we shall have horrors enough before the night is over  for goodness    sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful      about nine o   clock the light among the trees was extinguished  and all was dark in the direction of the manor house  two hours passed slowly away  and then  suddenly  just at the stroke of eleven  a single bright light shone out right in front of us      that is our signal     said holmes  springing to his feet     it comes from the middle window      as we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord  explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance  and that it was possible that we might spend the night there  a moment later we were out on the dark road  a chill wind blowing in our faces  and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand   there was little difficulty in entering the grounds  for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall  making our way among the trees  we reached the lawn  crossed it  and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child  who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness      my god     i whispered     did you see it      holmes was for the moment as startled as i  his hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation  then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear      it is a nice household     he murmured     that is the baboon      i had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected  there was a cheetah  too  perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment  i confess that i felt easier in my mind when  after following holmes    example and slipping off my shoes  i found myself inside the bedroom  my companion noiselessly closed the shutters  moved the lamp onto the table  and cast his eyes round the room  all was as we had seen it in the daytime  then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand  he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that i could do to distinguish the words      the least sound would be fatal to our plans      i nodded to show that i had heard      we must sit without light  he would see it through the ventilator      i nodded again      do not go asleep  your very life may depend upon it  have your pistol ready in case we should need it  i will sit on the side of the bed  and you in that chair      i took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table   holmes had brought up a long thin cane  and this he placed upon the bed beside him  by it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle  then he turned down the lamp  and we were left in darkness   how shall i ever forget that dreadful vigil  i could not hear a sound  not even the drawing of a breath  and yet i knew that my companion sat open eyed  within a few feet of me  in the same state of nervous tension in which i was myself  the shutters cut off the least ray of light  and we waited in absolute darkness   from outside came the occasional cry of a night bird  and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine  which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty  far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock  which boomed out every quarter of an hour  how long they seemed  those quarters  twelve struck  and one and two and three  and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall   suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator  which vanished immediately  but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal  someone in the next room had lit a dark lantern  i heard a gentle sound of movement  and then all was silent once more  though the smell grew stronger  for half an hour i sat with straining ears  then suddenly another sound became audible   a very gentle  soothing sound  like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle  the instant that we heard it  holmes sprang from the bed  struck a match  and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell pull      you see it  watson     he yelled     you see it      but i saw nothing  at the moment when holmes struck the light i heard a low  clear whistle  but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely  i could  however  see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing  he had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which i have ever listened  it swelled up louder and louder  a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek  they say that away down in the village  and even in the distant parsonage  that cry raised the sleepers from their beds  it struck cold to our hearts  and i stood gazing at holmes  and he at me  until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose      what can it mean     i gasped      it means that it is all over     holmes answered     and perhaps  after all  it is for the best  take your pistol  and we will enter dr  roylott   s room      with a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor  twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within  then he turned the handle and entered  i at his heels  with the cocked pistol in my hand   it was a singular sight which met our eyes  on the table stood a dark lantern with the shutter half open  throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe  the door of which was ajar  beside this table  on the wooden chair  sat dr  grimesby roylott clad in a long grey dressing gown  his bare ankles protruding beneath  and his feet thrust into red heelless turkish slippers  across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day  his chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful  rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling  round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band  with brownish speckles  which seemed to be bound tightly round his head  as we entered he made neither sound nor motion      the band  the speckled band     whispered holmes   i took a step forward  in an instant his strange headgear began to move  and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent      it is a swamp adder     cried holmes     the deadliest snake in india  he has died within ten seconds of being bitten  violence does  in truth  recoil upon the violent  and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another  let us thrust this creature back into its den  and we can then remove miss stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened      as he spoke he drew the dog whip swiftly from the dead man   s lap  and throwing the noose round the reptile   s neck he drew it from its horrid perch and  carrying it at arm   s length  threw it into the iron safe  which he closed upon it   such are the true facts of the death of dr  grimesby roylott  of stoke moran  it is not necessary that i should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl  how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at harrow  of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet  the little which i had yet to learn of the case was told me by sherlock holmes as we travelled back next day      i had     said he     come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows  my dear watson  how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data  the presence of the gipsies  and the use of the word    band     which was used by the poor girl  no doubt  to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match  were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent  i can only claim the merit that i instantly reconsidered my position when  however  it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door  my attention was speedily drawn  as i have already remarked to you  to this ventilator  and to the bell rope which hung down to the bed  the discovery that this was a dummy  and that the bed was clamped to the floor  instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed  the idea of a snake instantly occurred to me  and when i coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from india  i felt that i was probably on the right track  the idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an eastern training  the rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also  from his point of view  be an advantage  it would be a sharp eyed coroner  indeed  who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work  then i thought of the whistle  of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim  he had trained it  probably by the use of the milk which we saw  to return to him when summoned  he would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best  with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed  it might or might not bite the occupant  perhaps she might escape every night for a week  but sooner or later she must fall a victim      i had come to these conclusions before ever i had entered his room  an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it  which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator  the sight of the safe  the saucer of milk  and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained  the metallic clang heard by miss stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant  having once made up my mind  you know the steps which i took in order to put the matter to the proof  i heard the creature hiss as i have no doubt that you did also  and i instantly lit the light and attacked it         with the result of driving it through the ventilator         and also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side  some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper  so that it flew upon the first person it saw  in this way i am no doubt indirectly responsible for dr  grimesby roylott   s death  and i cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience        ix  the adventure of the engineer   s thumb  of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend  mr  sherlock holmes  for solution during the years of our intimacy  there were only two which i was the means of introducing to his notice   that of mr  hatherley   s thumb  and that of colonel warburton   s madness  of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer  but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record  even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results  the story has  i believe  been told more than once in the newspapers  but  like all such narratives  its effect is much less striking when set forth  en bloc  in a single half column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes  and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth  at the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me  and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect   it was in the summer of        not long after my marriage  that the events occurred which i am now about to summarise  i had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned holmes in his baker street rooms  although i continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us  my practice had steadily increased  and as i happened to live at no very great distance from paddington station  i got a few patients from among the officials  one of these  whom i had cured of a painful and lingering disease  was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence   one morning  at a little before seven o   clock  i was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from paddington and were waiting in the consulting room  i dressed hurriedly  for i knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial  and hastened downstairs  as i descended  my old ally  the guard  came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him      i   ve got him here     he whispered  jerking his thumb over his shoulder     he   s all right         what is it  then     i asked  for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room      it   s a new patient     he whispered     i thought i   d bring him round myself  then he couldn   t slip away  there he is  all safe and sound  i must go now  doctor  i have my dooties  just the same as you     and off he went  this trusty tout  without even giving me time to thank him   i entered my consulting room and found a gentleman seated by the table  he was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books  round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped  which was mottled all over with bloodstains  he was young  not more than five and twenty  i should say  with a strong  masculine face  but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation  which it took all his strength of mind to control      i am sorry to knock you up so early  doctor     said he     but i have had a very serious accident during the night  i came in by train this morning  and on inquiring at paddington as to where i might find a doctor  a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here  i gave the maid a card  but i see that she has left it upon the side table      i took it up and glanced at it     mr  victor hatherley  hydraulic engineer    a  victoria street   rd floor      that was the name  style  and abode of my morning visitor     i regret that i have kept you waiting     said i  sitting down in my library chair     you are fresh from a night journey  i understand  which is in itself a monotonous occupation         oh  my night could not be called monotonous     said he  and laughed  he laughed very heartily  with a high  ringing note  leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides  all my medical instincts rose up against that laugh      stop it     i cried     pull yourself together     and i poured out some water from a caraffe   it was useless  however  he was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone  presently he came to himself once more  very weary and pale looking      i have been making a fool of myself     he gasped      not at all  drink this     i dashed some brandy into the water  and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks      that   s better     said he     and now  doctor  perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb  or rather to the place where my thumb used to be      he unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand  it gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it  there were four protruding fingers and a horrid red  spongy surface where the thumb should have been  it had been hacked or torn right out from the roots      good heavens     i cried     this is a terrible injury  it must have bled considerably         yes  it did  i fainted when it was done  and i think that i must have been senseless for a long time  when i came to i found that it was still bleeding  so i tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig         excellent  you should have been a surgeon         it is a question of hydraulics  you see  and came within my own province         this has been done     said i  examining the wound     by a very heavy and sharp instrument         a thing like a cleaver     said he      an accident  i presume         by no means         what  a murderous attack         very murderous indeed         you horrify me      i sponged the wound  cleaned it  dressed it  and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages  he lay back without wincing  though he bit his lip from time to time      how is that     i asked when i had finished      capital  between your brandy and your bandage  i feel a new man  i was very weak  but i have had a good deal to go through         perhaps you had better not speak of the matter  it is evidently trying to your nerves         oh  no  not now  i shall have to tell my tale to the police  but  between ourselves  if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine  i should be surprised if they believed my statement  for it is a very extraordinary one  and i have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up  and  even if they believe me  the clues which i can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done         ha     cried i     if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved  i should strongly recommend you to come to my friend  mr  sherlock holmes  before you go to the official police         oh  i have heard of that fellow     answered my visitor     and i should be very glad if he would take the matter up  though of course i must use the official police as well  would you give me an introduction to him         i   ll do better  i   ll take you round to him myself         i should be immensely obliged to you         we   ll call a cab and go together  we shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him  do you feel equal to it         yes  i shall not feel easy until i have told my story         then my servant will call a cab  and i shall be with you in an instant     i rushed upstairs  explained the matter shortly to my wife  and in five minutes was inside a hansom  driving with my new acquaintance to baker street   sherlock holmes was  as i expected  lounging about his sitting room in his dressing gown  reading the agony column of  the times  and smoking his before breakfast pipe  which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before  all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece  he received us in his quietly genial fashion  ordered fresh rashers and eggs  and joined us in a hearty meal  when it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa  placed a pillow beneath his head  and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach      it is easy to see that your experience has been no common one  mr  hatherley     said he     pray  lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home  tell us what you can  but stop when you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant         thank you     said my patient     but i have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me  and i think that your breakfast has completed the cure  i shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible  so i shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences      holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary  heavy lidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature  while i sat opposite to him  and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us      you must know     said he     that i am an orphan and a bachelor  residing alone in lodgings in london  by profession i am a hydraulic engineer  and i have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that i was apprenticed to venner   matheson  the well known firm  of greenwich  two years ago  having served my time  and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father   s death  i determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in victoria street      i suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience  to me it has been exceptionally so  during two years i have had three consultations and one small job  and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me  my gross takings amount to          s   every day  from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon  i waited in my little den  until at last my heart began to sink  and i came to believe that i should never have any practice at all      yesterday  however  just as i was thinking of leaving the office  my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business  he brought up a card  too  with the name of    colonel lysander stark    engraved upon it  close at his heels came the colonel himself  a man rather over the middle size  but of an exceeding thinness  i do not think that i have ever seen so thin a man  his whole face sharpened away into nose and chin  and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones  yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit  and due to no disease  for his eye was bright  his step brisk  and his bearing assured  he was plainly but neatly dressed  and his age  i should judge  would be nearer forty than thirty         mr  hatherley     said he  with something of a german accent     you have been recommended to me  mr  hatherley  as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret         i bowed  feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address     may i ask who it was who gave me so good a character            well  perhaps it is better that i should not tell you that just at this moment  i have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in london            that is quite correct     i answered     but you will excuse me if i say that i cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications  i understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me            undoubtedly so  but you will find that all i say is really to the point  i have a professional commission for you  but absolute secrecy is quite essential   absolute secrecy  you understand  and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family            if i promise to keep a secret     said i     you may absolutely depend upon my doing so         he looked very hard at me as i spoke  and it seemed to me that i had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye         do you promise  then     said he at last         yes  i promise            absolute and complete silence before  during  and after  no reference to the matter at all  either in word or writing            i have already given you my word            very good     he suddenly sprang up  and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door  the passage outside was empty         that   s all right     said he  coming back     i know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master   s affairs  now we can talk in safety     he drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look      a feeling of repulsion  and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man  even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience         i beg that you will state your business  sir     said i     my time is of value     heaven forgive me for that last sentence  but the words came to my lips         how would fifty guineas for a night   s work suit you     he asked         most admirably            i say a night   s work  but an hour   s would be nearer the mark  i simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear  if you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves  what do you think of such a commission as that            the work appears to be light and the pay munificent            precisely so  we shall want you to come to night by the last train            where to            to eyford  in berkshire  it is a little place near the borders of oxfordshire  and within seven miles of reading  there is a train from paddington which would bring you there at about                  very good            i shall come down in a carriage to meet you            there is a drive  then            yes  our little place is quite out in the country  it is a good seven miles from eyford station            then we can hardly get there before midnight  i suppose there would be no chance of a train back  i should be compelled to stop the night            yes  we could easily give you a shake down            that is very awkward  could i not come at some more convenient hour            we have judged it best that you should come late  it is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you  a young and unknown man  a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession  still  of course  if you would like to draw out of the business  there is plenty of time to do so         i thought of the fifty guineas  and of how very useful they would be to me     not at all     said i     i shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes  i should like  however  to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do            quite so  it is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity  i have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you  i suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers            entirely            then the matter stands thus  you are probably aware that fuller   s earth is a valuable product  and that it is only found in one or two places in england            i have heard so            some little time ago i bought a small place   a very small place   within ten miles of reading  i was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller   s earth in one of my fields  on examining it  however  i found that this deposit was a comparatively small one  and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left   both of them  however  in the grounds of my neighbours  these good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold mine  naturally  it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value  but unfortunately i had no capital by which i could do this  i took a few of my friends into the secret  however  and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields  this we have now been doing for some time  and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press  this press  as i have already explained  has got out of order  and we wish your advice upon the subject  we guard our secret very jealously  however  and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house  it would soon rouse inquiry  and then  if the facts came out  it would be good bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans  that is why i have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to eyford to night  i hope that i make it all plain            i quite follow you     said i     the only point which i could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller   s earth  which  as i understand  is dug out like gravel from a pit            ah     said he carelessly     we have our own process  we compress the earth into bricks  so as to remove them without revealing what they are  but that is a mere detail  i have taken you fully into my confidence now  mr  hatherley  and i have shown you how i trust you     he rose as he spoke     i shall expect you  then  at eyford at                  i shall certainly be there            and not a word to a soul     he looked at me with a last long  questioning gaze  and then  pressing my hand in a cold  dank grasp  he hurried from the room      well  when i came to think it all over in cool blood i was very much astonished  as you may both think  at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me  on the one hand  of course  i was glad  for the fee was at least tenfold what i should have asked had i set a price upon my own services  and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones  on the other hand  the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me  and i could not think that his explanation of the fuller   s earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight  and his extreme anxiety lest i should tell anyone of my errand  however  i threw all fears to the winds  ate a hearty supper  drove to paddington  and started off  having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue      at reading i had to change not only my carriage but my station  however  i was in time for the last train to eyford  and i reached the little dim lit station after eleven o   clock  i was the only passenger who got out there  and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern  as i passed out through the wicket gate  however  i found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side  without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage  the door of which was standing open  he drew up the windows on either side  tapped on the wood work  and away we went as fast as the horse could go         one horse     interjected holmes      yes  only one         did you observe the colour         yes  i saw it by the side lights when i was stepping into the carriage  it was a chestnut         tired looking or fresh         oh  fresh and glossy         thank you  i am sorry to have interrupted you  pray continue your most interesting statement         away we went then  and we drove for at least an hour  colonel lysander stark had said that it was only seven miles  but i should think  from the rate that we seemed to go  and from the time that we took  that it must have been nearer twelve  he sat at my side in silence all the time  and i was aware  more than once when i glanced in his direction  that he was looking at me with great intensity  the country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world  for we lurched and jolted terribly  i tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were  but they were made of frosted glass  and i could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light  now and then i hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey  but the colonel answered only in monosyllables  and the conversation soon flagged  at last  however  the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel drive  and the carriage came to a stand  colonel lysander stark sprang out  and  as i followed after him  pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us  we stepped  as it were  right out of the carriage and into the hall  so that i failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house  the instant that i had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us  and i heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away      it was pitch dark inside the house  and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath  suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage  and a long  golden bar of light shot out in our direction  it grew broader  and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand  which she held above her head  pushing her face forward and peering at us  i could see that she was pretty  and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress i knew that it was a rich material  she spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question  and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand  colonel stark went up to her  whispered something in her ear  and then  pushing her back into the room from whence she had come  he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand         perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes     said he  throwing open another door  it was a quiet  little  plainly furnished room  with a round table in the centre  on which several german books were scattered  colonel stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door     i shall not keep you waiting an instant     said he  and vanished into the darkness      i glanced at the books upon the table  and in spite of my ignorance of german i could see that two of them were treatises on science  the others being volumes of poetry  then i walked across to the window  hoping that i might catch some glimpse of the country side  but an oak shutter  heavily barred  was folded across it  it was a wonderfully silent house  there was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage  but otherwise everything was deadly still  a vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me  who were these german people  and what were they doing living in this strange  out of the way place  and where was the place  i was ten miles or so from eyford  that was all i knew  but whether north  south  east  or west i had no idea  for that matter  reading  and possibly other large towns  were within that radius  so the place might not be so secluded  after all  yet it was quite certain  from the absolute stillness  that we were in the country  i paced up and down the room  humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that i was thoroughly earning my fifty guinea fee      suddenly  without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness  the door of my room swung slowly open  the woman was standing in the aperture  the darkness of the hall behind her  the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face  i could see at a glance that she was sick with fear  and the sight sent a chill to my own heart  she held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent  and she shot a few whispered words of broken english at me  her eyes glancing back  like those of a frightened horse  into the gloom behind her         i would go     said she  trying hard  as it seemed to me  to speak calmly     i would go  i should not stay here  there is no good for you to do            but  madam     said i     i have not yet done what i came for  i cannot possibly leave until i have seen the machine            it is not worth your while to wait     she went on     you can pass through the door  no one hinders     and then  seeing that i smiled and shook my head  she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward  with her hands wrung together     for the love of heaven     she whispered     get away from here before it is too late         but i am somewhat headstrong by nature  and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way  i thought of my fifty guinea fee  of my wearisome journey  and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me  was it all to go for nothing  why should i slink away without having carried out my commission  and without the payment which was my due  this woman might  for all i knew  be a monomaniac  with a stout bearing  therefore  though her manner had shaken me more than i cared to confess  i still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where i was  she was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead  and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs  she listened for an instant  threw up her hands with a despairing gesture  and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come      the newcomers were colonel lysander stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin  who was introduced to me as mr  ferguson         this is my secretary and manager     said the colonel     by the way  i was under the impression that i left this door shut just now  i fear that you have felt the draught            on the contrary     said i     i opened the door myself because i felt the room to be a little close         he shot one of his suspicious looks at me     perhaps we had better proceed to business  then     said he     mr  ferguson and i will take you up to see the machine            i had better put my hat on  i suppose            oh  no  it is in the house            what  you dig fuller   s earth in the house            no  no  this is only where we compress it  but never mind that  all we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it         we went upstairs together  the colonel first with the lamp  the fat manager and i behind him  it was a labyrinth of an old house  with corridors  passages  narrow winding staircases  and little low doors  the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them  there were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor  while the plaster was peeling off the walls  and the damp was breaking through in green  unhealthy blotches  i tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible  but i had not forgotten the warnings of the lady  even though i disregarded them  and i kept a keen eye upon my two companions  ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man  but i could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow countryman      colonel lysander stark stopped at last before a low door  which he unlocked  within was a small  square room  in which the three of us could hardly get at one time  ferguson remained outside  and the colonel ushered me in         we are now     said he     actually within the hydraulic press  and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on  the ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston  and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor  there are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force  and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you  the machine goes readily enough  but there is some stiffness in the working of it  and it has lost a little of its force  perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right         i took the lamp from him  and i examined the machine very thoroughly  it was indeed a gigantic one  and capable of exercising enormous pressure  when i passed outside  however  and pressed down the levers which controlled it  i knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage  which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders  an examination showed that one of the india rubber bands which was round the head of a driving rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked  this was clearly the cause of the loss of power  and i pointed it out to my companions  who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right  when i had made it clear to them  i returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity  it was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller   s earth was the merest fabrication  for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose  the walls were of wood  but the floor consisted of a large iron trough  and when i came to examine it i could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it  i had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when i heard a muttered exclamation in german and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me         what are you doing there     he asked      i felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me     i was admiring your fuller   s earth     said i     i think that i should be better able to advise you as to your machine if i knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used         the instant that i uttered the words i regretted the rashness of my speech  his face set hard  and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes         very well     said he     you shall know all about the machine     he took a step backward  slammed the little door  and turned the key in the lock  i rushed towards it and pulled at the handle  but it was quite secure  and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves     hullo     i yelled     hullo  colonel  let me out         and then suddenly in the silence i heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth  it was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder  he had set the engine at work  the lamp still stood upon the floor where i had placed it when examining the trough  by its light i saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me  slowly  jerkily  but  as none knew better than myself  with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp  i threw myself  screaming  against the door  and dragged with my nails at the lock  i implored the colonel to let me out  but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries  the ceiling was only a foot or two above my head  and with my hand upraised i could feel its hard  rough surface  then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which i met it  if i lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine  and i shuddered to think of that dreadful snap  easier the other way  perhaps  and yet  had i the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me  already i was unable to stand erect  when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart      i have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron  the walls were of wood  as i gave a last hurried glance around  i saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards  which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward  for an instant i could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death  the next instant i threw myself through  and lay half fainting upon the other side  the panel had closed again behind me  but the crash of the lamp  and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal  told me how narrow had been my escape      i was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist  and i found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor  while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand  while she held a candle in her right  it was the same good friend whose warning i had so foolishly rejected         come  come     she cried breathlessly     they will be here in a moment  they will see that you are not there  oh  do not waste the so precious time  but come         this time  at least  i did not scorn her advice  i staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair  the latter led to another broad passage  and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices  one answering the other from the floor on which  we were and from the one beneath  my guide stopped and looked about her like one  who is at her wit   s end  then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom  through the window of which the moon was shining brightly         it is your only chance     said she     it is high  but it may be that you can jump it         as she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage  and i saw the lean figure of colonel lysander stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher   s cleaver in the other  i rushed across the bedroom  flung open the window  and looked out  how quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight  and it could not be more than thirty feet down  i clambered out upon the sill  but i hesitated to jump until i should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me  if she were ill used  then at any risks i was determined to go back to her assistance  the thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door  pushing his way past her  but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back         fritz  fritz     she cried in english     remember your promise after the last time  you said it should not be again  he will be silent  oh  he will be silent            you are mad  elise     he shouted  struggling to break away from her     you will be the ruin of us  he has seen too much  let me pass  i say     he dashed her to one side  and  rushing to the window  cut at me with his heavy weapon  i had let myself go  and was hanging by the hands to the sill  when his blow fell  i was conscious of a dull pain  my grip loosened  and i fell into the garden below      i was shaken but not hurt by the fall  so i picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as i could run  for i understood that i was far from being out of danger yet  suddenly  however  as i ran  a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me  i glanced down at my hand  which was throbbing painfully  and then  for the first time  saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound  i endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it  but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears  and next moment i fell in a dead faint among the rose bushes      how long i remained unconscious i cannot tell  it must have been a very long time  for the moon had sunk  and a bright morning was breaking when i came to myself  my clothes were all sodden with dew  and my coat sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb  the smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night   s adventure  and i sprang to my feet with the feeling that i might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers  but to my astonishment  when i came to look round me  neither house nor garden were to be seen  i had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad  and just a little lower down was a long building  which proved  upon my approaching it  to be the very station at which i had arrived upon the previous night  were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand  all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream      half dazed  i went into the station and asked about the morning train  there would be one to reading in less than an hour  the same porter was on duty  i found  as had been there when i arrived  i inquired of him whether he had ever heard of colonel lysander stark  the name was strange to him  had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me  no  he had not  was there a police station anywhere near  there was one about three miles off      it was too far for me to go  weak and ill as i was  i determined to wait until i got back to town before telling my story to the police  it was a little past six when i arrived  so i went first to have my wound dressed  and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here  i put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise      we both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative  then sherlock holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings      here is an advertisement which will interest you     said he     it appeared in all the papers about a year ago  listen to this     lost  on the  th inst   mr  jeremiah hayling  aged twenty six  a hydraulic engineer  left his lodgings at ten o   clock at night  and has not been heard of since  was dressed in     etc   etc  ha  that represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled  i fancy         good heavens     cried my patient     then that explains what the girl said         undoubtedly  it is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man  who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game  like those out and out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship  well  every moment now is precious  so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to scotland yard at once as a preliminary to starting for eyford      some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together  bound from reading to the little berkshire village  there were sherlock holmes  the hydraulic engineer  inspector bradstreet  of scotland yard  a plain clothes man  and myself  bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with eyford for its centre      there you are     said he     that circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village  the place we want must be somewhere near that line  you said ten miles  i think  sir         it was an hour   s good drive         and you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious         they must have done so  i have a confused memory  too  of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere         what i cannot understand     said i     is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden  perhaps the villain was softened by the woman   s entreaties         i hardly think that likely  i never saw a more inexorable face in my life         oh  we shall soon clear up all that     said bradstreet     well  i have drawn my circle  and i only wish i knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found         i think i could lay my finger on it     said holmes quietly      really  now     cried the inspector     you have formed your opinion  come  now  we shall see who agrees with you  i say it is south  for the country is more deserted there         and i say east     said my patient      i am for west     remarked the plain clothes man     there are several quiet little villages up there         and i am for north     said i     because there are no hills there  and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any         come     cried the inspector  laughing     it   s a very pretty diversity of opinion  we have boxed the compass among us  who do you give your casting vote to         you are all wrong         but we can   t all be         oh  yes  you can  this is my point     he placed his finger in the centre of the circle     this is where we shall find them         but the twelve mile drive     gasped hatherley      six out and six back  nothing simpler  you say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in  how could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads         indeed  it is a likely ruse enough     observed bradstreet thoughtfully     of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang         none at all     said holmes     they are coiners on a large scale  and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver         we have known for some time that a clever gang was at work     said the inspector     they have been turning out half crowns by the thousand  we even traced them as far as reading  but could get no farther  for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands  but now  thanks to this lucky chance  i think that we have got them right enough      but the inspector was mistaken  for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice  as we rolled into eyford station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape      a house on fire     asked bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way      yes  sir     said the station master      when did it break out         i hear that it was during the night  sir  but it has got worse  and the whole place is in a blaze         whose house is it         dr  becher   s         tell me     broke in the engineer     is dr  becher a german  very thin  with a long  sharp nose      the station master laughed heartily     no  sir  dr  becher is an englishman  and there isn   t a man in the parish who has a better lined waistcoat  but he has a gentleman staying with him  a patient  as i understand  who is a foreigner  and he looks as if a little good berkshire beef would do him no harm      the station master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire  the road topped a low hill  and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us  spouting fire at every chink and window  while in the garden in front three fire engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under      that   s it     cried hatherley  in intense excitement     there is the gravel drive  and there are the rose bushes where i lay  that second window is the one that i jumped from         well  at least     said holmes     you have had your revenge upon them  there can be no question that it was your oil lamp which  when it was crushed in the press  set fire to the wooden walls  though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time  now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night  though i very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now      and holmes    fears came to be realised  for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman  the sinister german  or the morose englishman  early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of reading  but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared  and even holmes    ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts   the firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within  and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window sill of the second floor  about sunset  however  their efforts were at last successful  and they subdued the flames  but not before the roof had fallen in  and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that  save some twisted cylinders and iron piping  not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly  large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an out house  but no coins were to be found  which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to   how our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould  which told us a very plain tale  he had evidently been carried down by two persons  one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones  on the whole  it was most probable that the silent englishman  being less bold or less murderous than his companion  had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger      well     said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to london     it has been a pretty business for me  i have lost my thumb and i have lost a fifty guinea fee  and what have i gained         experience     said holmes  laughing     indirectly it may be of value  you know  you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence        x  the adventure of the noble bachelor  the lord st  simon marriage  and its curious termination  have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves  fresh scandals have eclipsed it  and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four year old drama  as i have reason to believe  however  that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public  and as my friend sherlock holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up  i feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode   it was a few weeks before my own marriage  during the days when i was still sharing rooms with holmes in baker street  that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him  i had remained indoors all day  for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain  with high autumnal winds  and the jezail bullet which i had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence  with my body in one easy chair and my legs upon another  i had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last  saturated with the news of the day  i tossed them all aside and lay listless  watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend   s noble correspondent could be      here is a very fashionable epistle     i remarked as he entered     your morning letters  if i remember right  were from a fish monger and a tide waiter         yes  my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety     he answered  smiling     and the humbler are usually the more interesting  this looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie      he broke the seal and glanced over the contents      oh  come  it may prove to be something of interest  after all         not social  then         no  distinctly professional         and from a noble client         one of the highest in england         my dear fellow  i congratulate you         i assure you  watson  without affectation  that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case  it is just possible  however  that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation  you have been reading the papers diligently of late  have you not         it looks like it     said i ruefully  pointing to a huge bundle in the corner     i have had nothing else to do         it is fortunate  for you will perhaps be able to post me up  i read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column  the latter is always instructive  but if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about lord st  simon and his wedding         oh  yes  with the deepest interest         that is well  the letter which i hold in my hand is from lord st  simon  i will read it to you  and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter  this is what he says             my dear mr  sherlock holmes    lord backwater tells me that i may     place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion  i have     determined  therefore  to call upon you and to consult you in     reference to the very painful event which has occurred in     connection with my wedding  mr  lestrade  of scotland yard  is     acting already in the matter  but he assures me that he sees no     objection to your co operation  and that he even thinks that it     might be of some assistance  i will call at four o   clock in the     afternoon  and  should you have any other engagement at that time      i hope that you will postpone it  as this matter is of paramount     importance  yours faithfully              robert st  simon          it is dated from grosvenor mansions  written with a quill pen  and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger     remarked holmes as he folded up the epistle      he says four o   clock  it is three now  he will be here in an hour         then i have just time  with your assistance  to get clear upon the subject  turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time  while i take a glance as to who our client is     he picked a red covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece     here he is     said he  sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee        lord robert walsingham de vere st  simon  second son of the duke of balmoral     hum     arms  azure  three caltrops in chief over a fess sable  born in          he   s forty one years of age  which is mature for marriage  was under secretary for the colonies in a late administration  the duke  his father  was at one time secretary for foreign affairs  they inherit plantagenet blood by direct descent  and tudor on the distaff side  ha  well  there is nothing very instructive in all this  i think that i must turn to you watson  for something more solid         i have very little difficulty in finding what i want     said i     for the facts are quite recent  and the matter struck me as remarkable  i feared to refer them to you  however  as i knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters         oh  you mean the little problem of the grosvenor square furniture van  that is quite cleared up now   though  indeed  it was obvious from the first  pray give me the results of your newspaper selections         here is the first notice which i can find  it is in the personal column of the  morning post   and dates  as you see  some weeks back     a marriage has been arranged     it says     and will  if rumour is correct  very shortly take place  between lord robert st  simon  second son of the duke of balmoral  and miss hatty doran  the only daughter of aloysius doran  esq   of san francisco  cal   u s a     that is all         terse and to the point     remarked holmes  stretching his long  thin legs towards the fire      there was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week  ah  here it is     there will soon be a call for protection in the marriage  market  for the present free trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product  one by one the management of the noble houses of great britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the atlantic  an important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders  lord st  simon  who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little god   s arrows  has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with miss hatty doran  the fascinating daughter of a california millionaire  miss doran  whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the westbury house festivities  is an only child  and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures  with expectancies for the future  as it is an open secret that the duke of balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years  and as lord st  simon has no property of his own save the small estate of birchmoor  it is obvious that the californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a republican lady to a british peeress            anything else     asked holmes  yawning      oh  yes  plenty  then there is another note in the  morning post  to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one  that it would be at st  george   s  hanover square  that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited  and that the party would return to the furnished house at lancaster gate which has been taken by mr  aloysius doran  two days later   that is  on wednesday last   there is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place  and that the honeymoon would be passed at lord backwater   s place  near petersfield  those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride         before the what     asked holmes with a start      the vanishing of the lady         when did she vanish  then         at the wedding breakfast         indeed  this is more interesting than it promised to be  quite dramatic  in fact         yes  it struck me as being a little out of the common         they often vanish before the ceremony  and occasionally during the honeymoon  but i cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this  pray let me have the details         i warn you that they are very incomplete         perhaps we may make them less so         such as they are  they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday  which i will read to you  it is headed     singular occurrence at a fashionable wedding            the family of lord robert st  simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding  the ceremony  as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday  occurred on the previous morning  but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about  in spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up  so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation         the ceremony  which was performed at st  george   s  hanover square  was a very quiet one  no one being present save the father of the bride  mr  aloysius doran  the duchess of balmoral  lord backwater  lord eustace and lady clara st  simon  the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom   and lady alicia whittington  the whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of mr  aloysius doran  at lancaster gate  where breakfast had been prepared  it appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman  whose name has not been ascertained  who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party  alleging that she had some claim upon lord st  simon  it was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman  the bride  who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption  had sat down to breakfast with the rest  when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room  her prolonged absence having caused some comment  her father followed her  but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant  caught up an ulster and bonnet  and hurried down to the passage  one of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled  but had refused to credit that it was his mistress  believing her to be with the company  on ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared  mr  aloysius doran  in conjunction with the bridegroom  instantly put themselves in communication with the police  and very energetic inquiries are being made  which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business  up to a late hour last night  however  nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady  there are rumours of foul play in the matter  and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance  in the belief that  from jealousy or some other motive  she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride            and is that all         only one little item in another of the morning papers  but it is a suggestive one         and it is           that miss flora millar  the lady who had caused the disturbance  has actually been arrested  it appears that she was formerly a  danseuse  at the allegro  and that she has known the bridegroom for some years  there are no further particulars  and the whole case is in your hands now   so far as it has been set forth in the public press         and an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be  i would not have missed it for worlds  but there is a ring at the bell  watson  and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four  i have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client  do not dream of going  watson  for i very much prefer having a witness  if only as a check to my own memory         lord robert st  simon     announced our page boy  throwing open the door  a gentleman entered  with a pleasant  cultured face  high nosed and pale  with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth  and with the steady  well opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed  his manner was brisk  and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age  for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked  his hair  too  as he swept off his very curly brimmed hat  was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top  as to his dress  it was careful to the verge of foppishness  with high collar  black frock coat  white waistcoat  yellow gloves  patent leather shoes  and light coloured gaiters  he advanced slowly into the room  turning his head from left to right  and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses      good day  lord st  simon     said holmes  rising and bowing     pray take the basket chair  this is my friend and colleague  dr  watson  draw up a little to the fire  and we will talk this matter over         a most painful matter to me  as you can most readily imagine  mr  holmes  i have been cut to the quick  i understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort  sir  though i presume that they were hardly from the same class of society         no  i am descending         i beg pardon         my last client of the sort was a king         oh  really  i had no idea  and which king         the king of scandinavia         what  had he lost his wife         you can understand     said holmes suavely     that i extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which i promise to you in yours         of course  very right  very right  i   m sure i beg pardon  as to my own case  i am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion         thank you  i have already learned all that is in the public prints  nothing more  i presume that i may take it as correct   this article  for example  as to the disappearance of the bride      lord st  simon glanced over it     yes  it is correct  as far as it goes         but it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion  i think that i may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you         pray do so         when did you first meet miss hatty doran         in san francisco  a year ago         you were travelling in the states         yes         did you become engaged then         no         but you were on a friendly footing         i was amused by her society  and she could see that i was amused         her father is very rich         he is said to be the richest man on the pacific slope         and how did he make his money         in mining  he had nothing a few years ago  then he struck gold  invested it  and came up by leaps and bounds         now  what is your own impression as to the young lady   s   your wife   s character      the nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire     you see  mr  holmes     said he     my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man  during that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains  so that her education has come from nature rather than from the schoolmaster  she is what we call in england a tomboy  with a strong nature  wild and free  unfettered by any sort of traditions  she is impetuous   volcanic  i was about to say  she is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions  on the other hand  i would not have given her the name which i have the honour to bear      he gave a little stately cough      had i not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman  i believe that she is capable of heroic self sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her         have you her photograph         i brought this with me     he opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman  it was not a photograph but an ivory miniature  and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair  the large dark eyes  and the exquisite mouth  holmes gazed long and earnestly at it  then he closed the locket and handed it back to lord st  simon      the young lady came to london  then  and you renewed your acquaintance         yes  her father brought her over for this last london season  i met her several times  became engaged to her  and have now married her         she brought  i understand  a considerable dowry         a fair dowry  not more than is usual in my family         and this  of course  remains to you  since the marriage is a  fait accompli          i really have made no inquiries on the subject         very naturally not  did you see miss doran on the day before the wedding         yes         was she in good spirits         never better  she kept talking of what we should do in our future lives         indeed  that is very interesting  and on the morning of the wedding         she was as bright as possible   at least until after the ceremony         and did you observe any change in her then         well  to tell the truth  i saw then the first signs that i had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp  the incident however  was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case         pray let us have it  for all that         oh  it is childish  she dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry  she was passing the front pew at the time  and it fell over into the pew  there was a moment   s delay  but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again  and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall  yet when i spoke to her of the matter  she answered me abruptly  and in the carriage  on our way home  she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause         indeed  you say that there was a gentleman in the pew  some of the general public were present  then         oh  yes  it is impossible to exclude them when the church is open         this gentleman was not one of your wife   s friends         no  no  i call him a gentleman by courtesy  but he was quite a common looking person  i hardly noticed his appearance  but really i think that we are wandering rather far from the point         lady st  simon  then  returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it  what did she do on re entering her father   s house         i saw her in conversation with her maid         and who is her maid         alice is her name  she is an american and came from california with her         a confidential servant         a little too much so  it seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties  still  of course  in america they look upon these things in a different way         how long did she speak to this alice         oh  a few minutes  i had something else to think of         you did not overhear what they said         lady st  simon said something about    jumping a claim     she was accustomed to use slang of the kind  i have no idea what she meant         american slang is very expressive sometimes  and what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid         she walked into the breakfast room         on your arm         no  alone  she was very independent in little matters like that  then  after we had sat down for ten minutes or so  she rose hurriedly  muttered some words of apology  and left the room  she never came back         but this maid  alice  as i understand  deposes that she went to her room  covered her bride   s dress with a long ulster  put on a bonnet  and went out         quite so  and she was afterwards seen walking into hyde park in company with flora millar  a woman who is now in custody  and who had already made a disturbance at mr  doran   s house that morning         ah  yes  i should like a few particulars as to this young lady  and your relations to her      lord st  simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows     we have been on a friendly footing for some years   i may say on a  very  friendly footing  she used to be at the allegro  i have not treated her ungenerously  and she had no just cause of complaint against me  but you know what women are  mr  holmes  flora was a dear little thing  but exceedingly hot headed and devotedly attached to me  she wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that i was about to be married  and  to tell the truth  the reason why i had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that i feared lest there might be a scandal in the church  she came to mr  doran   s door just after we returned  and she endeavoured to push her way in  uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife  and even threatening her  but i had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort  and i had two police fellows there in private clothes  who soon pushed her out again  she was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row         did your wife hear all this         no  thank goodness  she did not         and she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards         yes  that is what mr  lestrade  of scotland yard  looks upon as so serious  it is thought that flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her         well  it is a possible supposition         you think so  too         i did not say a probable one  but you do not yourself look upon this as likely         i do not think flora would hurt a fly         still  jealousy is a strange transformer of characters  pray what is your own theory as to what took place         well  really  i came to seek a theory  not to propound one  i have given you all the facts  since you ask me  however  i may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair  the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride  had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife         in short  that she had become suddenly deranged         well  really  when i consider that she has turned her back   i will not say upon me  but upon so much that many have aspired to without success   i can hardly explain it in any other fashion         well  certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis     said holmes  smiling     and now  lord st  simon  i think that i have nearly all my data  may i ask whether you were seated at the breakfast table so that you could see out of the window         we could see the other side of the road and the park         quite so  then i do not think that i need to detain you longer  i shall communicate with you         should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem     said our client  rising      i have solved it         eh  what was that         i say that i have solved it         where  then  is my wife         that is a detail which i shall speedily supply      lord st  simon shook his head     i am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine     he remarked  and bowing in a stately  old fashioned manner he departed      it is very good of lord st  simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own     said sherlock holmes  laughing     i think that i shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross questioning  i had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room         my dear holmes         i have notes of several similar cases  though none  as i remarked before  which were quite as prompt  my whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty  circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing  as when you find a trout in the milk  to quote thoreau   s example         but i have heard all that you have heard         without  however  the knowledge of pre existing cases which serves me so well  there was a parallel instance in aberdeen some years back  and something on very much the same lines at munich the year after the franco prussian war  it is one of these cases   but  hullo  here is lestrade  good afternoon  lestrade  you will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard  and there are cigars in the box      the official detective was attired in a pea jacket and cravat  which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance  and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand  with a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him      what   s up  then     asked holmes with a twinkle in his eye     you look dissatisfied         and i feel dissatisfied  it is this infernal st  simon marriage case  i can make neither head nor tail of the business         really  you surprise me         who ever heard of such a mixed affair  every clue seems to slip through my fingers  i have been at work upon it all day         and very wet it seems to have made you     said holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea jacket      yes  i have been dragging the serpentine         in heaven   s name  what for         in search of the body of lady st  simon      sherlock holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily      have you dragged the basin of trafalgar square fountain     he asked      why  what do you mean         because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other      lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion     i suppose you know all about it     he snarled      well  i have only just heard the facts  but my mind is made up         oh  indeed  then you think that the serpentine plays no part in the matter         i think it very unlikely         then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it     he opened his bag as he spoke  and tumbled onto the floor a wedding dress of watered silk  a pair of white satin shoes and a bride   s wreath and veil  all discoloured and soaked in water     there     said he  putting a new wedding ring upon the top of the pile     there is a little nut for you to crack  master holmes         oh  indeed     said my friend  blowing blue rings into the air     you dragged them from the serpentine         no  they were found floating near the margin by a park keeper  they have been identified as her clothes  and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off         by the same brilliant reasoning  every man   s body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe  and pray what did you hope to arrive at through this         at some evidence implicating flora millar in the disappearance         i am afraid that you will find it difficult         are you  indeed  now     cried lestrade with some bitterness     i am afraid  holmes  that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences  you have made two blunders in as many minutes  this dress does implicate miss flora millar         and how         in the dress is a pocket  in the pocket is a card case  in the card case is a note  and here is the very note     he slapped it down upon the table in front of him     listen to this     you will see me when all is ready  come at once  f  h  m     now my theory all along has been that lady st  simon was decoyed away by flora millar  and that she  with confederates  no doubt  was responsible for her disappearance  here  signed with her initials  is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach         very good  lestrade     said holmes  laughing     you really are very fine indeed  let me see it     he took up the paper in a listless way  but his attention instantly became riveted  and he gave a little cry of satisfaction     this is indeed important     said he      ha  you find it so         extremely so  i congratulate you warmly      lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look     why     he shrieked     you   re looking at the wrong side         on the contrary  this is the right side         the right side  you   re mad  here is the note written in pencil over here         and over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill  which interests me deeply         there   s nothing in it  i looked at it before     said lestrade        oct   th  rooms   s    breakfast   s     d    cocktail   s    lunch   s     d    glass sherry    d      i see nothing in that         very likely not  it is most important  all the same  as to the note  it is important also  or at least the initials are  so i congratulate you again         i   ve wasted time enough     said lestrade  rising     i believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories  good day  mr  holmes  and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first     he gathered up the garments  thrust them into the bag  and made for the door      just one hint to you  lestrade     drawled holmes before his rival vanished     i will tell you the true solution of the matter  lady st  simon is a myth  there is not  and there never has been  any such person      lestrade looked sadly at my companion  then he turned to me  tapped his forehead three times  shook his head solemnly  and hurried away   he had hardly shut the door behind him when holmes rose to put on his overcoat     there is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work     he remarked     so i think  watson  that i must leave you to your papers for a little      it was after five o   clock when sherlock holmes left me  but i had no time to be lonely  for within an hour there arrived a confectioner   s man with a very large flat box  this he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him  and presently  to my very great astonishment  a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging house mahogany  there were a couple of brace of cold woodcock  a pheasant  a  p  t   de foie gras  pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles  having laid out all these luxuries  my two visitors vanished away  like the genii of the arabian nights  with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address   just before nine o   clock sherlock holmes stepped briskly into the room  his features were gravely set  but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions      they have laid the supper  then     he said  rubbing his hands      you seem to expect company  they have laid for five         yes  i fancy we may have some company dropping in     said he     i am surprised that lord st  simon has not already arrived  ha  i fancy that i hear his step now upon the stairs      it was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in  dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever  and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features      my messenger reached you  then     asked holmes      yes  and i confess that the contents startled me beyond measure  have you good authority for what you say         the best possible      lord st  simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead      what will the duke say     he murmured     when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation         it is the purest accident  i cannot allow that there is any humiliation         ah  you look on these things from another standpoint         i fail to see that anyone is to blame  i can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise  though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted  having no mother  she had no one to advise her at such a crisis         it was a slight  sir  a public slight     said lord st  simon  tapping his fingers upon the table      you must make allowance for this poor girl  placed in so unprecedented a position         i will make no allowance  i am very angry indeed  and i have been shamefully used         i think that i heard a ring     said holmes     yes  there are steps on the landing  if i cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter  lord st  simon  i have brought an advocate here who may be more successful     he opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman     lord st  simon     said he    allow me to introduce you to mr  and mrs  francis hay moulton  the lady  i think  you have already met      at the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect  with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock coat  a picture of offended dignity  the lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him  but he still refused to raise his eyes  it was as well for his resolution  perhaps  for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist      you   re angry  robert     said she     well  i guess you have every cause to be         pray make no apology to me     said lord st  simon bitterly      oh  yes  i know that i have treated you real bad and that i should have spoken to you before i went  but i was kind of rattled  and from the time when i saw frank here again i just didn   t know what i was doing or saying  i only wonder i didn   t fall down and do a faint right there before the altar         perhaps  mrs  moulton  you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter         if i may give an opinion     remarked the strange gentleman     we   ve had just a little too much secrecy over this business already  for my part  i should like all europe and america to hear the rights of it     he was a small  wiry  sunburnt man  clean shaven  with a sharp face and alert manner      then i   ll tell our story right away     said the lady     frank here and i met in        in mcquire   s camp  near the rockies  where pa was working a claim  we were engaged to each other  frank and i  but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile  while poor frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing  the richer pa grew the poorer was frank  so at last pa wouldn   t hear of our engagement lasting any longer  and he took me away to    frisco  frank wouldn   t throw up his hand  though  so he followed me there  and he saw me without pa knowing anything about it  it would only have made him mad to know  so we just fixed it all up for ourselves  frank said that he would go and make his pile  too  and never come back to claim me until he had as much as pa  so then i promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived     why shouldn   t we be married right away  then     said he     and then i will feel sure of you  and i won   t claim to be your husband until i come back     well  we talked it over  and he had fixed it all up so nicely  with a clergyman all ready in waiting  that we just did it right there  and then frank went off to seek his fortune  and i went back to pa      the next i heard of frank was that he was in montana  and then he went prospecting in arizona  and then i heard of him from new mexico  after that came a long newspaper story about how a miners    camp had been attacked by apache indians  and there was my frank   s name among the killed  i fainted dead away  and i was very sick for months after  pa thought i had a decline and took me to half the doctors in    frisco  not a word of news came for a year and more  so that i never doubted that frank was really dead  then lord st  simon came to    frisco  and we came to london  and a marriage was arranged  and pa was very pleased  but i felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor frank      still  if i had married lord st  simon  of course i   d have done my duty by him  we can   t command our love  but we can our actions  i went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be  but you may imagine what i felt when  just as i came to the altar rails  i glanced back and saw frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew  i thought it was his ghost at first  but when i looked again there he was still  with a kind of question in his eyes  as if to ask me whether i were glad or sorry to see him  i wonder i didn   t drop  i know that everything was turning round  and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear  i didn   t know what to do  should i stop the service and make a scene in the church  i glanced at him again  and he seemed to know what i was thinking  for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still  then i saw him scribble on a piece of paper  and i knew that he was writing me a note  as i passed his pew on the way out i dropped my bouquet over to him  and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers  it was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so  of course i never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him  and i determined to do just whatever he might direct      when i got back i told my maid  who had known him in california  and had always been his friend  i ordered her to say nothing  but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready  i know i ought to have spoken to lord st  simon  but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people  i just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards  i hadn   t been at the table ten minutes before i saw frank out of the window at the other side of the road  he beckoned to me and then began walking into the park  i slipped out  put on my things  and followed him  some woman came talking something or other about lord st  simon to me   seemed to me from the little i heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also   but i managed to get away from her and soon overtook frank  we got into a cab together  and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in gordon square  and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting  frank had been a prisoner among the apaches  had escaped  came on to    frisco  found that i had given him up for dead and had gone to england  followed me there  and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding         i saw it in a paper     explained the american     it gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived         then we had a talk as to what we should do  and frank was all for openness  but i was so ashamed of it all that i felt as if i should like to vanish away and never see any of them again   just sending a line to pa  perhaps  to show him that i was alive  it was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast table and waiting for me to come back  so frank took my wedding clothes and things and made a bundle of them  so that i should not be traced  and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them  it is likely that we should have gone on to paris to morrow  only that this good gentleman  mr  holmes  came round to us this evening  though how he found us is more than i can think  and he showed us very clearly and kindly that i was wrong and that frank was right  and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret  then he offered to give us a chance of talking to lord st  simon alone  and so we came right away round to his rooms at once  now  robert  you have heard it all  and i am very sorry if i have given you pain  and i hope that you do not think very meanly of me      lord st  simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude  but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative      excuse me     he said     but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner         then you won   t forgive me  you won   t shake hands before i go         oh  certainly  if it would give you any pleasure     he put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him      i had hoped     suggested holmes     that you would have joined us in a friendly supper         i think that there you ask a little too much     responded his lordship     i may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments  but i can hardly be expected to make merry over them  i think that with your permission i will now wish you all a very good night     he included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room      then i trust that you at least will honour me with your company     said sherlock holmes     it is always a joy to meet an american  mr  moulton  for i am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far gone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same world wide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the union jack with the stars and stripes         the case has been an interesting one     remarked holmes when our visitors had left us     because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable  nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady  and nothing stranger than the result when viewed  for instance  by mr  lestrade of scotland yard         you were not yourself at fault at all  then         from the first  two facts were very obvious to me  the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony  the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home  obviously something had occurred during the morning  then  to cause her to change her mind  what could that something be  she could not have spoken to anyone when she was out  for she had been in the company of the bridegroom  had she seen someone  then  if she had  it must be someone from america because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely  you see we have already arrived  by a process of exclusion  at the idea that she might have seen an american  then who could this american be  and why should he possess so much influence over her  it might be a lover  it might be a husband  her young womanhood had  i knew  been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions  so far i had got before i ever heard lord st  simon   s narrative  when he told us of a man in a pew  of the change in the bride   s manner  of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet  of her resort to her confidential maid  and of her very significant allusion to claim jumping   which in miners    parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to   the whole situation became absolutely clear  she had gone off with a man  and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband   the chances being in favour of the latter         and how in the world did you find them         it might have been difficult  but friend lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know  the initials were  of course  of the highest importance  but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select london hotels         how did you deduce the select         by the select prices  eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels  there are not many in london which charge at that rate  in the second one which i visited in northumberland avenue  i learned by an inspection of the book that francis h  moulton  an american gentleman  had left only the day before  and on looking over the entries against him  i came upon the very items which i had seen in the duplicate bill  his letters were to be forwarded to     gordon square  so thither i travelled  and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home  i ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to lord st  simon in particular  i invited them to meet him here  and  as you see  i made him keep the appointment         but with no very good result     i remarked     his conduct was certainly not very gracious         ah  watson     said holmes  smiling     perhaps you would not be very gracious either  if  after all the trouble of wooing and wedding  you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune  i think that we may judge lord st  simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position  draw your chair up and hand me my violin  for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings        xi  the adventure of the beryl coronet     holmes     said i as i stood one morning in our bow window looking down the street     here is a madman coming along  it seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone      my friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing gown  looking over my shoulder  it was a bright  crisp february morning  and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground  shimmering brightly in the wintry sun  down the centre of baker street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic  but at either side and on the heaped up edges of the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell  the grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped  but was still dangerously slippery  so that there were fewer passengers than usual  indeed  from the direction of the metropolitan station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention   he was a man of about fifty  tall  portly  and imposing  with a massive  strongly marked face and a commanding figure  he was dressed in a sombre yet rich style  in black frock coat  shining hat  neat brown gaiters  and well cut pearl grey trousers  yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features  for he was running hard  with occasional little springs  such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs  as he ran he jerked his hands up and down  waggled his head  and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions      what on earth can be the matter with him     i asked     he is looking up at the numbers of the houses         i believe that he is coming here     said holmes  rubbing his hands      here         yes  i rather think he is coming to consult me professionally  i think that i recognise the symptoms  ha  did i not tell you     as he spoke  the man  puffing and blowing  rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging   a few moments later he was in our room  still puffing  still gesticulating  but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity  for a while he could not get his words out  but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason  then  suddenly springing to his feet  he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room  sherlock holmes pushed him down into the easy chair and  sitting beside him  patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy  soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ      you have come to me to tell your story  have you not     said he     you are fatigued with your haste  pray wait until you have recovered yourself  and then i shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me      the man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest  fighting against his emotion  then he passed his handkerchief over his brow  set his lips tight  and turned his face towards us      no doubt you think me mad     said he      i see that you have had some great trouble     responded holmes      god knows i have    a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason  so sudden and so terrible is it  public disgrace i might have faced  although i am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain  private affliction also is the lot of every man  but the two coming together  and in so frightful a form  have been enough to shake my very soul  besides  it is not i alone  the very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair         pray compose yourself  sir     said holmes     and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you         my name     answered our visitor     is probably familiar to your ears  i am alexander holder  of the banking firm of holder   stevenson  of threadneedle street      the name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the city of london  what could have happened  then  to bring one of the foremost citizens of london to this most pitiable pass  we waited  all curiosity  until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story      i feel that time is of value     said he     that is why i hastened here when the police inspector suggested that i should secure your co operation  i came to baker street by the underground and hurried from there on foot  for the cabs go slowly through this snow  that is why i was so out of breath  for i am a man who takes very little exercise  i feel better now  and i will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as i can      it is  of course  well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors  one of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans  where the security is unimpeachable  we have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years  and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures  libraries  or plate      yesterday morning i was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks  i started when i saw the name  for it was that of none other than   well  perhaps even to you i had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth   one of the highest  noblest  most exalted names in england  i was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted  when he entered  to say so  but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task         mr  holder     said he     i have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money            the firm does so when the security is good     i answered         it is absolutely essential to me     said he     that i should have           at once  i could  of course  borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends  but i much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself  in my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one   s self under obligations            for how long  may i ask  do you want this sum     i asked         next monday i have a large sum due to me  and i shall then most certainly repay what you advance  with whatever interest you think it right to charge  but it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once            i should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse     said i     were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear  if  on the other hand  i am to do it in the name of the firm  then in justice to my partner i must insist that  even in your case  every businesslike precaution should be taken            i should much prefer to have it so     said he  raising up a square  black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair     you have doubtless heard of the beryl coronet            one of the most precious public possessions of the empire     said i         precisely     he opened the case  and there  imbedded in soft  flesh coloured velvet  lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named     there are thirty nine enormous beryls     said he     and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable  the lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which i have asked  i am prepared to leave it with you as my security         i took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client         you doubt its value     he asked         not at all  i only doubt              the propriety of my leaving it  you may set your mind at rest about that  i should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that i should be able in four days to reclaim it  it is a pure matter of form  is the security sufficient            ample            you understand  mr  holder  that i am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which i have in you  founded upon all that i have heard of you  i rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but  above all  to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because i need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it  any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss  for there are no beryls in the world to match these  and it would be impossible to replace them  i leave it with you  however  with every confidence  and i shall call for it in person on monday morning         seeing that my client was anxious to leave  i said no more but  calling for my cashier  i ordered him to pay over fifty         notes  when i was alone once more  however  with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me  i could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me  there could be no doubt that  as it was a national possession  a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it  i already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it  however  it was too late to alter the matter now  so i locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work      when evening came i felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me  bankers    safes had been forced before now  and why should not mine be  if so  how terrible would be the position in which i should find myself  i determined  therefore  that for the next few days i would always carry the case backward and forward with me  so that it might never be really out of my reach  with this intention  i called a cab and drove out to my house at streatham  carrying the jewel with me  i did not breathe freely until i had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing room      and now a word as to my household  mr  holmes  for i wish you to thoroughly understand the situation  my groom and my page sleep out of the house  and may be set aside altogether  i have three maid servants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion  another  lucy parr  the second waiting maid  has only been in my service a few months  she came with an excellent character  however  and has always given me satisfaction  she is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place  that is the only drawback which we have found to her  but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way      so much for the servants  my family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it  i am a widower and have an only son  arthur  he has been a disappointment to me  mr  holmes   a grievous disappointment  i have no doubt that i am myself to blame  people tell me that i have spoiled him  very likely i have  when my dear wife died i felt that he was all i had to love  i could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face  i have never denied him a wish  perhaps it would have been better for both of us had i been sterner  but i meant it for the best      it was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business  but he was not of a business turn  he was wild  wayward  and  to speak the truth  i could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money  when he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club  and there  having charming manners  he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits  he learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf  until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance  that he might settle his debts of honour  he tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping  but each time the influence of his friend  sir george burnwell  was enough to draw him back again      and  indeed  i could not wonder that such a man as sir george burnwell should gain an influence over him  for he has frequently brought him to my house  and i have found myself that i could hardly resist the fascination of his manner  he is older than arthur  a man of the world to his finger tips  one who had been everywhere  seen everything  a brilliant talker  and a man of great personal beauty  yet when i think of him in cold blood  far away from the glamour of his presence  i am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which i have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted  so i think  and so  too  thinks my little mary  who has a woman   s quick insight into character      and now there is only she to be described  she is my niece  but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world i adopted her  and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter  she is a sunbeam in my house   sweet  loving  beautiful  a wonderful manager and housekeeper  yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be  she is my right hand  i do not know what i could do without her  in only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes  twice my boy has asked her to marry him  for he loves her devotedly  but each time she has refused him  i think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she  and that his marriage might have changed his whole life  but now  alas  it is too late   forever too late      now  mr  holmes  you know the people who live under my roof  and i shall continue with my miserable story      when we were taking coffee in the drawing room that night after dinner  i told arthur and mary my experience  and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof  suppressing only the name of my client  lucy parr  who had brought in the coffee  had  i am sure  left the room  but i cannot swear that the door was closed  mary and arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet  but i thought it better not to disturb it         where have you put it     asked arthur         in my own bureau            well  i hope to goodness the house won   t be burgled during the night     said he         it is locked up     i answered         oh  any old key will fit that bureau  when i was a youngster i have opened it myself with the key of the box room cupboard         he often had a wild way of talking  so that i thought little of what he said  he followed me to my room  however  that night with a very grave face         look here  dad     said he with his eyes cast down     can you let me have                   no  i cannot     i answered sharply     i have been far too generous with you in money matters            you have been very kind     said he     but i must have this money  or else i can never show my face inside the club again            and a very good thing  too     i cried         yes  but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man     said he     i could not bear the disgrace  i must raise the money in some way  and if you will not let me have it  then i must try other means         i was very angry  for this was the third demand during the month     you shall not have a farthing from me     i cried  on which he bowed and left the room without another word      when he was gone i unlocked my bureau  made sure that my treasure was safe  and locked it again  then i started to go round the house to see that all was secure   a duty which i usually leave to mary but which i thought it well to perform myself that night  as i came down the stairs i saw mary herself at the side window of the hall  which she closed and fastened as i approached         tell me  dad     said she  looking  i thought  a little disturbed     did you give lucy  the maid  leave to go out to night            certainly not            she came in just now by the back door  i have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone  but i think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped            you must speak to her in the morning  or i will if you prefer it  are you sure that everything is fastened            quite sure  dad            then  good night     i kissed her and went up to my bedroom again  where i was soon asleep      i am endeavouring to tell you everything  mr  holmes  which may have any bearing upon the case  but i beg that you will question me upon any point which i do not make clear         on the contrary  your statement is singularly lucid         i come to a part of my story now in which i should wish to be particularly so  i am not a very heavy sleeper  and the anxiety in my mind tended  no doubt  to make me even less so than usual  about two in the morning  then  i was awakened by some sound in the house  it had ceased ere i was wide awake  but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere  i lay listening with all my ears  suddenly  to my horror  there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room  i slipped out of bed  all palpitating with fear  and peeped round the corner of my dressing room door         arthur     i screamed     you villain  you thief  how dare you touch that coronet         the gas was half up  as i had left it  and my unhappy boy  dressed only in his shirt and trousers  was standing beside the light  holding the coronet in his hands  he appeared to be wrenching at it  or bending it with all his strength  at my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death  i snatched it up and examined it  one of the gold corners  with three of the beryls in it  was missing         you blackguard     i shouted  beside myself with rage     you have destroyed it  you have dishonoured me forever  where are the jewels which you have stolen            stolen     he cried         yes  thief     i roared  shaking him by the shoulder         there are none missing  there cannot be any missing     said he         there are three missing  and you know where they are  must i call you a liar as well as a thief  did i not see you trying to tear off another piece            you have called me names enough     said he     i will not stand it any longer  i shall not say another word about this business  since you have chosen to insult me  i will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world            you shall leave it in the hands of the police     i cried half mad with grief and rage     i shall have this matter probed to the bottom            you shall learn nothing from me     said he with a passion such as i should not have thought was in his nature     if you choose to call the police  let the police find what they can         by this time the whole house was astir  for i had raised my voice in my anger  mary was the first to rush into my room  and  at the sight of the coronet and of arthur   s face  she read the whole story and  with a scream  fell down senseless on the ground  i sent the housemaid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once  when the inspector and a constable entered the house  arthur  who had stood sullenly with his arms folded  asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft  i answered that it had ceased to be a private matter  but had become a public one  since the ruined coronet was national property  i was determined that the law should have its way in everything         at least     said he     you will not have me arrested at once  it would be to your advantage as well as mine if i might leave the house for five minutes            that you may get away  or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen     said i  and then  realising the dreadful position in which i was placed  i implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than i was at stake  and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation  he might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones         you may as well face the matter     said i     you have been caught in the act  and no confession could make your guilt more heinous  if you but make such reparation as is in your power  by telling us where the beryls are  all shall be forgiven and forgotten            keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it     he answered  turning away from me with a sneer  i saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him  there was but one way for it  i called in the inspector and gave him into custody  a search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems  but no trace of them could be found  nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats  this morning he was removed to a cell  and i  after going through all the police formalities  have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter  the police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it  you may go to any expense which you think necessary  i have already offered a reward of          my god  what shall i do  i have lost my honour  my gems  and my son in one night  oh  what shall i do      he put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro  droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words   sherlock holmes sat silent for some few minutes  with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire      do you receive much company     he asked      none save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of arthur   s  sir george burnwell has been several times lately  no one else  i think         do you go out much in society         arthur does  mary and i stay at home  we neither of us care for it         that is unusual in a young girl         she is of a quiet nature  besides  she is not so very young  she is four and twenty         this matter  from what you say  seems to have been a shock to her also         terrible  she is even more affected than i         you have neither of you any doubt as to your son   s guilt         how can we have when i saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands         i hardly consider that a conclusive proof  was the remainder of the coronet at all injured         yes  it was twisted         do you not think  then  that he might have been trying to straighten it         god bless you  you are doing what you can for him and for me  but it is too heavy a task  what was he doing there at all  if his purpose were innocent  why did he not say so         precisely  and if it were guilty  why did he not invent a lie  his silence appears to me to cut both ways  there are several singular points about the case  what did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep         they considered that it might be caused by arthur   s closing his bedroom door         a likely story  as if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household  what did they say  then  of the disappearance of these gems         they are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them         have they thought of looking outside the house         yes  they have shown extraordinary energy  the whole garden has already been minutely examined         now  my dear sir     said holmes     is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think  it appeared to you to be a simple case  to me it seems exceedingly complex  consider what is involved by your theory  you suppose that your son came down from his bed  went  at great risk  to your dressing room  opened your bureau  took out your coronet  broke off by main force a small portion of it  went off to some other place  concealed three gems out of the thirty nine  with such skill that nobody can find them  and then returned with the other thirty six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered  i ask you now  is such a theory tenable         but what other is there     cried the banker with a gesture of despair     if his motives were innocent  why does he not explain them         it is our task to find that out     replied holmes     so now  if you please  mr  holder  we will set off for streatham together  and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details      my friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition  which i was eager enough to do  for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened  i confess that the guilt of the banker   s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father  but still i had such faith in holmes    judgment that i felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation  he hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb  but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes  sunk in the deepest thought  our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him  and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs  a short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to fairbank  the modest residence of the great financier   fairbank was a good sized square house of white stone  standing back a little from the road  a double carriage sweep  with a snow clad lawn  stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance  on the right side was a small wooden thicket  which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door  and forming the tradesmen   s entrance  on the left ran a lane which led to the stables  and was not itself within the grounds at all  being a public  though little used  thoroughfare  holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house  across the front  down the tradesmen   s path  and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane  so long was he that mr  holder and i went into the dining room and waited by the fire until he should return  we were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in  she was rather above the middle height  slim  with dark hair and eyes  which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin  i do not think that i have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman   s face  her lips  too  were bloodless  but her eyes were flushed with crying  as she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning  and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character  with immense capacity for self restraint  disregarding my presence  she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress      you have given orders that arthur should be liberated  have you not  dad     she asked      no  no  my girl  the matter must be probed to the bottom         but i am so sure that he is innocent  you know what woman   s instincts are  i know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly         why is he silent  then  if he is innocent         who knows  perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him         how could i help suspecting him  when i actually saw him with the coronet in his hand         oh  but he had only picked it up to look at it  oh  do  do take my word for it that he is innocent  let the matter drop and say no more  it is so dreadful to think of our dear arthur in prison         i shall never let it drop until the gems are found   never  mary  your affection for arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me  far from hushing the thing up  i have brought a gentleman down from london to inquire more deeply into it         this gentleman     she asked  facing round to me      no  his friend  he wished us to leave him alone  he is round in the stable lane now         the stable lane     she raised her dark eyebrows     what can he hope to find there  ah  this  i suppose  is he  i trust  sir  that you will succeed in proving  what i feel sure is the truth  that my cousin arthur is innocent of this crime         i fully share your opinion  and i trust  with you  that we may prove it     returned holmes  going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes     i believe i have the honour of addressing miss mary holder  might i ask you a question or two         pray do  sir  if it may help to clear this horrible affair up         you heard nothing yourself last night         nothing  until my uncle here began to speak loudly  i heard that  and i came down         you shut up the windows and doors the night before  did you fasten all the windows         yes         were they all fastened this morning         yes         you have a maid who has a sweetheart  i think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him         yes  and she was the girl who waited in the drawing room  and who may have heard uncle   s remarks about the coronet         i see  you infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart  and that the two may have planned the robbery         but what is the good of all these vague theories     cried the banker impatiently     when i have told you that i saw arthur with the coronet in his hands         wait a little  mr  holder  we must come back to that  about this girl  miss holder  you saw her return by the kitchen door  i presume         yes  when i went to see if the door was fastened for the night i met her slipping in  i saw the man  too  in the gloom         do you know him         oh  yes  he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round  his name is francis prosper         he stood     said holmes     to the left of the door   that is to say  farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door         yes  he did         and he is a man with a wooden leg      something like fear sprang up in the young lady   s expressive black eyes     why  you are like a magician     said she     how do you know that     she smiled  but there was no answering smile in holmes    thin  eager face      i should be very glad now to go upstairs     said he     i shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again  perhaps i had better take a look at the lower windows before i go up      he walked swiftly round from one to the other  pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane  this he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens     now we shall go upstairs     said he at last   the banker   s dressing room was a plainly furnished little chamber  with a grey carpet  a large bureau  and a long mirror  holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock      which key was used to open it     he asked      that which my son himself indicated   that of the cupboard of the lumber room         have you it here         that is it on the dressing table      sherlock holmes took it up and opened the bureau      it is a noiseless lock     said he     it is no wonder that it did not wake you  this case  i presume  contains the coronet  we must have a look at it     he opened the case  and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table  it was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller   s art  and the thirty six stones were the finest that i have ever seen  at one side of the coronet was a cracked edge  where a corner holding three gems had been torn away      now  mr  holder     said holmes     here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost  might i beg that you will break it off      the banker recoiled in horror     i should not dream of trying     said he      then i will     holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it  but without result     i feel it give a little     said he     but  though i am exceptionally strong in the fingers  it would take me all my time to break it  an ordinary man could not do it  now  what do you think would happen if i did break it  mr  holder  there would be a noise like a pistol shot  do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it         i do not know what to think  it is all dark to me         but perhaps it may grow lighter as we go  what do you think  miss holder         i confess that i still share my uncle   s perplexity         your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him         he had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt         thank you  we have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry  and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up  with your permission  mr  holder  i shall now continue my investigations outside      he went alone  at his own request  for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult  for an hour or more he was at work  returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever      i think that i have seen now all that there is to see  mr  holder     said he     i can serve you best by returning to my rooms         but the gems  mr  holmes  where are they         i cannot tell      the banker wrung his hands     i shall never see them again     he cried     and my son  you give me hopes         my opinion is in no way altered         then  for god   s sake  what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night         if you can call upon me at my baker street rooms to morrow morning between nine and ten i shall be happy to do what i can to make it clearer  i understand that you give me  carte blanche  to act for you  provided only that i get back the gems  and that you place no limit on the sum i may draw         i would give my fortune to have them back         very good  i shall look into the matter between this and then  good bye  it is just possible that i may have to come over here again before evening      it was obvious to me that my companion   s mind was now made up about the case  although what his conclusions were was more than i could even dimly imagine  several times during our homeward journey i endeavoured to sound him upon the point  but he always glided away to some other topic  until at last i gave it over in despair  it was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more  he hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer  with his collar turned up  his shiny  seedy coat  his red cravat  and his worn boots  he was a perfect sample of the class      i think that this should do     said he  glancing into the glass above the fireplace     i only wish that you could come with me  watson  but i fear that it won   t do  i may be on the trail in this matter  or i may be following a will o    the wisp  but i shall soon know which it is  i hope that i may be back in a few hours     he cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard  sandwiched it between two rounds of bread  and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition   i had just finished my tea when he returned  evidently in excellent spirits  swinging an old elastic sided boot in his hand  he chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea      i only looked in as i passed     said he     i am going right on         where to         oh  to the other side of the west end  it may be some time before i get back  don   t wait up for me in case i should be late         how are you getting on         oh  so so  nothing to complain of  i have been out to streatham since i saw you last  but i did not call at the house  it is a very sweet little problem  and i would not have missed it for a good deal  however  i must not sit gossiping here  but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self      i could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply  his eyes twinkled  and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks  he hastened upstairs  and a few minutes later i heard the slam of the hall door  which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt   i waited until midnight  but there was no sign of his return  so i retired to my room  it was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent  so that his lateness caused me no surprise  i do not know at what hour he came in  but when i came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other  as fresh and trim as possible      you will excuse my beginning without you  watson     said he     but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning         why  it is after nine now     i answered     i should not be surprised if that were he  i thought i heard a ring      it was  indeed  our friend the financier  i was shocked by the change which had come over him  for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould  was now pinched and fallen in  while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter  he entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before  and he dropped heavily into the armchair which i pushed forward for him      i do not know what i have done to be so severely tried     said he     only two days ago i was a happy and prosperous man  without a care in the world  now i am left to a lonely and dishonoured age  one sorrow comes close upon the heels of another  my niece  mary  has deserted me         deserted you         yes  her bed this morning had not been slept in  her room was empty  and a note for me lay upon the hall table  i had said to her last night  in sorrow and not in anger  that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him  perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so  it is to that remark that she refers in this note             my dearest uncle    i feel that i have brought trouble upon you      and that if i had acted differently this terrible misfortune might     never have occurred  i cannot  with this thought in my mind  ever     again be happy under your roof  and i feel that i must leave you     forever  do not worry about my future  for that is provided for      and  above all  do not search for me  for it will be fruitless     labour and an ill service to me  in life or in death  i am ever     your loving              mary          what could she mean by that note  mr  holmes  do you think it points to suicide         no  no  nothing of the kind  it is perhaps the best possible solution  i trust  mr  holder  that you are nearing the end of your troubles         ha  you say so  you have heard something  mr  holmes  you have learned something  where are the gems         you would not think         apiece an excessive sum for them         i would pay ten         that would be unnecessary  three thousand will cover the matter  and there is a little reward  i fancy  have you your cheque book  here is a pen  better make it out for              with a dazed face the banker made out the required check  holmes walked over to his desk  took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it  and threw it down upon the table   with a shriek of joy our client clutched it up      you have it     he gasped     i am saved  i am saved      the reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been  and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom      there is one other thing you owe  mr  holder     said sherlock holmes rather sternly      owe     he caught up a pen     name the sum  and i will pay it         no  the debt is not to me  you owe a very humble apology to that noble lad  your son  who has carried himself in this matter as i should be proud to see my own son do  should i ever chance to have one         then it was not arthur who took them         i told you yesterday  and i repeat to day  that it was not         you are sure of it  then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known         he knows it already  when i had cleared it all up i had an interview with him  and finding that he would not tell me the story  i told it to him  on which he had to confess that i was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me  your news of this morning  however  may open his lips         for heaven   s sake  tell me  then  what is this extraordinary mystery         i will do so  and i will show you the steps by which i reached it  and let me say to you  first  that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear  there has been an understanding between sir george burnwell and your niece mary  they have now fled together         my mary  impossible         it is unfortunately more than possible  it is certain  neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle  he is one of the most dangerous men in england   a ruined gambler  an absolutely desperate villain  a man without heart or conscience  your niece knew nothing of such men  when he breathed his vows to her  as he had done to a hundred before her  she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart  the devil knows best what he said  but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening         i cannot  and i will not  believe it     cried the banker with an ashen face      i will tell you  then  what occurred in your house last night  your niece  when you had  as she thought  gone to your room  slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane  his footmarks had pressed right through the snow  so long had he stood there  she told him of the coronet  his wicked lust for gold kindled at the news  and he bent her to his will  i have no doubt that she loved you  but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves  and i think that she must have been one  she had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs  on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants    escapade with her wooden legged lover  which was all perfectly true      your boy  arthur  went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts  in the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door  so he rose and  looking out  was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressing room  petrified with astonishment  the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair  presently she emerged from the room again  and in the light of the passage lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands  she passed down the stairs  and he  thrilling with horror  ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door  whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath  he saw her stealthily open the window  hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom  and then closing it once more hurry back to her room  passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain      as long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved  but the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you  and how all important it was to set it right  he rushed down  just as he was  in his bare feet  opened the window  sprang out into the snow  and ran down the lane  where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight  sir george burnwell tried to get away  but arthur caught him  and there was a struggle between them  your lad tugging at one side of the coronet  and his opponent at the other  in the scuffle  your son struck sir george and cut him over the eye  then something suddenly snapped  and your son  finding that he had the coronet in his hands  rushed back  closed the window  ascended to your room  and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene         is it possible     gasped the banker      you then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks  he could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands  he took the more chivalrous view  however  and preserved her secret         and that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet     cried mr  holder     oh  my god  what a blind fool i have been  and his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes  the dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle  how cruelly i have misjudged him         when i arrived at the house     continued holmes     i at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me  i knew that none had fallen since the evening before  and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions  i passed along the tradesmen   s path  but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable  just beyond it  however  at the far side of the kitchen door  a woman had stood and talked with a man  whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg  i could even tell that they had been disturbed  for the woman had run back swiftly to the door  as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks  while wooden leg had waited a little  and then had gone away  i thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart  of whom you had already spoken to me  and inquiry showed it was so  i passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks  which i took to be the police  but when i got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me      there was a double line of tracks of a booted man  and a second double line which i saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet  i was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son  the first had walked both ways  but the other had run swiftly  and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot  it was obvious that he had passed after the other  i followed them up and found they led to the hall window  where boots had worn all the snow away while waiting  then i walked to the other end  which was a hundred yards or more down the lane  i saw where boots had faced round  where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle  and  finally  where a few drops of blood had fallen  to show me that i was not mistaken  boots had then run down the lane  and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt  when he came to the highroad at the other end  i found that the pavement had been cleared  so there was an end to that clue      on entering the house  however  i examined  as you remember  the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens  and i could at once see that someone had passed out  i could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in  i was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred  a man had waited outside the window  someone had brought the gems  the deed had been overseen by your son  he had pursued the thief  had struggled with him  they had each tugged at the coronet  their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected  he had returned with the prize  but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent  so far i was clear  the question now was  who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet      it is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible  whatever remains  however improbable  must be the truth  now  i knew that it was not you who had brought it down  so there only remained your niece and the maids  but if it were the maids  why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place  there could be no possible reason  as he loved his cousin  however  there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret   the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one  when i remembered that you had seen her at that window  and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again  my conjecture became a certainty      and who could it be who was her confederate  a lover evidently  for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you  i knew that you went out little  and that your circle of friends was a very limited one  but among them was sir george burnwell  i had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women  it must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems  even though he knew that arthur had discovered him  he might still flatter himself that he was safe  for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family      well  your own good sense will suggest what measures i took next  i went in the shape of a loafer to sir george   s house  managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet  learned that his master had cut his head the night before  and  finally  at the expense of six shillings  made all sure by buying a pair of his cast off shoes  with these i journeyed down to streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks         i saw an ill dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening     said mr  holder      precisely  it was i  i found that i had my man  so i came home and changed my clothes  it was a delicate part which i had to play then  for i saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal  and i knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter  i went and saw him  at first  of course  he denied everything  but when i gave him every particular that had occurred  he tried to bluster and took down a life preserver from the wall  i knew my man  however  and i clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike  then he became a little more reasonable  i told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held           apiece  that brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown     why  dash it all     said he     i   ve let them go at six hundred for the three     i soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them  on promising him that there would be no prosecution  off i set to him  and after much chaffering i got our stones at         apiece  then i looked in upon your son  told him that all was right  and eventually got to my bed about two o   clock  after what i may call a really hard day   s work         a day which has saved england from a great public scandal     said the banker  rising     sir  i cannot find words to thank you  but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done  your skill has indeed exceeded all that i have heard of it  and now i must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which i have done him  as to what you tell me of poor mary  it goes to my very heart  not even your skill can inform me where she is now         i think that we may safely say     returned holmes     that she is wherever sir george burnwell is  it is equally certain  too  that whatever her sins are  they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment        xii  the adventure of the copper beeches     to the man who loves art for its own sake     remarked sherlock holmes  tossing aside the advertisement sheet of  the daily telegraph      it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived  it is pleasant to me to observe  watson  that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up  and  i am bound to say  occasionally to embellish  you have given prominence not so much to the many  causes c  l  bres  and sensational trials in which i have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves  but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which i have made my special province         and yet     said i  smiling     i cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records         you have erred  perhaps     he observed  taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood      you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing         it seems to me that i have done you full justice in the matter     i remarked with some coldness  for i was repelled by the egotism which i had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend   s singular character      no  it is not selfishness or conceit     said he  answering  as was his wont  my thoughts rather than my words     if i claim full justice for my art  it is because it is an impersonal thing   a thing beyond myself  crime is common  logic is rare  therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell  you have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales      it was a cold morning of the early spring  and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at baker street  a thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun coloured houses  and the opposing windows loomed like dark  shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths  our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal  for the table had not been cleared yet  sherlock holmes had been silent all the morning  dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last  having apparently given up his search  he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings      at the same time     he remarked after a pause  during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire     you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism  for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in  a fair proportion do not treat of crime  in its legal sense  at all  the small matter in which i endeavoured to help the king of bohemia  the singular experience of miss mary sutherland  the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip  and the incident of the noble bachelor  were all matters which are outside the pale of the law  but in avoiding the sensational  i fear that you may have bordered on the trivial         the end may have been so     i answered     but the methods i hold to have been novel and of interest         pshaw  my dear fellow  what do the public  the great unobservant public  who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb  care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction  but  indeed  if you are trivial  i cannot blame you  for the days of the great cases are past  man  or at least criminal man  has lost all enterprise and originality  as to my own little practice  it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding schools  i think that i have touched bottom at last  however  this note i had this morning marks my zero point  i fancy  read it     he tossed a crumpled letter across to me   it was dated from montague place upon the preceding evening  and ran thus          dear mr  holmes    i am very anxious to consult you as to whether i     should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to     me as governess  i shall call at half past ten to morrow if i do     not inconvenience you  yours faithfully           violet hunter          do you know the young lady     i asked      not i         it is half past ten now         yes  and i have no doubt that is her ring         it may turn out to be of more interest than you think  you remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle  which appeared to be a mere whim at first  developed into a serious investigation  it may be so in this case  also         well  let us hope so  but our doubts will very soon be solved  for here  unless i am much mistaken  is the person in question      as he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room  she was plainly but neatly dressed  with a bright  quick face  freckled like a plover   s egg  and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world      you will excuse my troubling you  i am sure     said she  as my companion rose to greet her     but i have had a very strange experience  and as i have no parents or relations of any sort from whom i could ask advice  i thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what i should do         pray take a seat  miss hunter  i shall be happy to do anything that i can to serve you      i could see that holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client  he looked her over in his searching fashion  and then composed himself  with his lids drooping and his finger tips together  to listen to her story      i have been a governess for five years     said she     in the family of colonel spence munro  but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at halifax  in nova scotia  and took his children over to america with him  so that i found myself without a situation  i advertised  and i answered advertisements  but without success  at last the little money which i had saved began to run short  and i was at my wit   s end as to what i should do      there is a well known agency for governesses in the west end called westaway   s  and there i used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me  westaway was the name of the founder of the business  but it is really managed by miss stoper  she sits in her own little office  and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom  and are then shown in one by one  when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them      well  when i called last week i was shown into the little office as usual  but i found that miss stoper was not alone  a prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose  looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered  as i came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to miss stoper         that will do     said he     i could not ask for anything better  capital  capital     he seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion  he was such a comfortable looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him         you are looking for a situation  miss     he asked         yes  sir            as governess            yes  sir            and what salary do you ask            i had      a month in my last place with colonel spence munro            oh  tut  tut  sweating   rank sweating     he cried  throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion     how could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments            my accomplishments  sir  may be less than you imagine     said i     a little french  a little german  music  and drawing              tut  tut     he cried     this is all quite beside the question  the point is  have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady  there it is in a nutshell  if you have not  you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country  but if you have why  then  how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures  your salary with me  madam  would commence at        a year         you may imagine  mr  holmes  that to me  destitute as i was  such an offer seemed almost too good to be true  the gentleman  however  seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face  opened a pocket book and took out a note         it is also my custom     said he  smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face     to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand  so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe         it seemed to me that i had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man  as i was already in debt to my tradesmen  the advance was a great convenience  and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before i quite committed myself         may i ask where you live  sir     said i         hampshire  charming rural place  the copper beeches  five miles on the far side of winchester  it is the most lovely country  my dear young lady  and the dearest old country house            and my duties  sir  i should be glad to know what they would be            one child   one dear little romper just six years old  oh  if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper  smack  smack  smack  three gone before you could wink     he leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again      i was a little startled at the nature of the child   s amusement  but the father   s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking         my sole duties  then     i asked     are to take charge of a single child            no  no  not the sole  not the sole  my dear young lady     he cried     your duty would be  as i am sure your good sense would suggest  to obey any little commands my wife might give  provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey  you see no difficulty  heh            i should be happy to make myself useful            quite so  in dress now  for example  we are faddy people  you know   faddy but kind hearted  if you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you  you would not object to our little whim  heh            no     said i  considerably astonished at his words         or to sit here  or sit there  that would not be offensive to you            oh  no            or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us         i could hardly believe my ears  as you may observe  mr  holmes  my hair is somewhat luxuriant  and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut  it has been considered artistic  i could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion         i am afraid that that is quite impossible     said i  he had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes  and i could see a shadow pass over his face as i spoke         i am afraid that it is quite essential     said he     it is a little fancy of my wife   s  and ladies    fancies  you know  madam  ladies    fancies must be consulted  and so you won   t cut your hair            no  sir  i really could not     i answered firmly         ah  very well  then that quite settles the matter  it is a pity  because in other respects you would really have done very nicely  in that case  miss stoper  i had best inspect a few more of your young ladies         the manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us  but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that i could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal         do you desire your name to be kept upon the books     she asked         if you please  miss stoper            well  really  it seems rather useless  since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion     said she sharply     you can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you  good day to you  miss hunter     she struck a gong upon the table  and i was shown out by the page      well  mr  holmes  when i got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard  and two or three bills upon the table  i began to ask myself whether i had not done a very foolish thing  after all  if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters  they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity  very few governesses in england are getting        a year  besides  what use was my hair to me  many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps i should be among the number  next day i was inclined to think that i had made a mistake  and by the day after i was sure of it  i had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when i received this letter from the gentleman himself  i have it here and i will read it to you         the copper beeches  near winchester             dear miss hunter    miss stoper has very kindly given me your     address  and i write from here to ask you whether you have     reconsidered your decision  my wife is very anxious that you should     come  for she has been much attracted by my description of you  we     are willing to give       a quarter  or        a year  so as to     recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may     cause you  they are not very exacting  after all  my wife is fond     of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear     such a dress indoors in the morning  you need not  however  go to     the expense of purchasing one  as we have one belonging to my dear     daughter alice  now in philadelphia   which would  i should think      fit you very well  then  as to sitting here or there  or amusing     yourself in any manner indicated  that need cause you no     inconvenience  as regards your hair  it is no doubt a pity      especially as i could not help remarking its beauty during our     short interview  but i am afraid that i must remain firm upon this     point  and i only hope that the increased salary may recompense you     for the loss  your duties  as far as the child is concerned  are     very light  now do try to come  and i shall meet you with the     dog cart at winchester  let me know your train  yours faithfully              jephro rucastle          that is the letter which i have just received  mr  holmes  and my mind is made up that i will accept it  i thought  however  that before taking the final step i should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration         well  miss hunter  if your mind is made up  that settles the question     said holmes  smiling      but you would not advise me to refuse         i confess that it is not the situation which i should like to see a sister of mine apply for         what is the meaning of it all  mr  holmes         ah  i have no data  i cannot tell  perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion         well  there seems to me to be only one possible solution  mr  rucastle seemed to be a very kind  good natured man  is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic  that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum  and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak         that is a possible solution   in fact  as matters stand  it is the most probable one  but in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady         but the money  mr  holmes  the money         well  yes  of course the pay is good   too good  that is what makes me uneasy  why should they give you        a year  when they could have their pick for        there must be some strong reason behind         i thought that if i told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if i wanted your help  i should feel so much stronger if i felt that you were at the back of me         oh  you may carry that feeling away with you  i assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months  there is something distinctly novel about some of the features  if you should find yourself in doubt or in danger           danger  what danger do you foresee      holmes shook his head gravely     it would cease to be a danger if we could define it     said he     but at any time  day or night  a telegram would bring me down to your help         that is enough     she rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face     i shall go down to hampshire quite easy in my mind now  i shall write to mr  rucastle at once  sacrifice my poor hair to night  and start for winchester to morrow     with a few grateful words to holmes she bade us both good night and bustled off upon her way      at least     said i as we heard her quick  firm steps descending the stairs     she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself         and she would need to be     said holmes gravely     i am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past      it was not very long before my friend   s prediction was fulfilled  a fortnight went by  during which i frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into  the unusual salary  the curious conditions  the light duties  all pointed to something abnormal  though whether a fad or a plot  or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain  it was quite beyond my powers to determine  as to holmes  i observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end  with knitted brows and an abstracted air  but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when i mentioned it     data  data  data     he cried impatiently     i can   t make bricks without clay     and yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation   the telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as i was thinking of turning in and holmes was settling down to one of those all night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in  when i would leave him stooping over a retort and a test tube at night and find him in the same position when i came down to breakfast in the morning  he opened the yellow envelope  and then  glancing at the message  threw it across to me      just look up the trains in bradshaw     said he  and turned back to his chemical studies   the summons was a brief and urgent one      please be at the black swan hotel at winchester at midday to morrow     it said     do come  i am at my wit   s end       hunter          will you come with me     asked holmes  glancing up      i should wish to         just look it up  then         there is a train at half past nine     said i  glancing over my bradshaw     it is due at winchester at               that will do very nicely  then perhaps i had better postpone my analysis of the acetones  as we may need to be at our best in the morning      by eleven o   clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old english capital  holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down  but after we had passed the hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery  it was an ideal spring day  a light blue sky  flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east  the sun was shining very brightly  and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air  which set an edge to a man   s energy  all over the countryside  away to the rolling hills around aldershot  the little red and grey roofs of the farm steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage      are they not fresh and beautiful     i cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of baker street   but holmes shook his head gravely      do you know  watson     said he     that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that i must look at everything with reference to my own special subject  you look at these scattered houses  and you are impressed by their beauty  i look at them  and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there         good heavens     i cried     who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads         they always fill me with a certain horror  it is my belief  watson  founded upon my experience  that the lowest and vilest alleys in london do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside         you horrify me         but the reason is very obvious  the pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish  there is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child  or the thud of a drunkard   s blow  does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours  and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going  and there is but a step between the crime and the dock  but look at these lonely houses  each in its own fields  filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law  think of the deeds of hellish cruelty  the hidden wickedness which may go on  year in  year out  in such places  and none the wiser  had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in winchester  i should never have had a fear for her  it is the five miles of country which makes the danger  still  it is clear that she is not personally threatened         no  if she can come to winchester to meet us she can get away         quite so  she has her freedom         what  can  be the matter  then  can you suggest no explanation         i have devised seven separate explanations  each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them  but which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us  well  there is the tower of the cathedral  and we shall soon learn all that miss hunter has to tell      the black swan is an inn of repute in the high street  at no distance from the station  and there we found the young lady waiting for us  she had engaged a sitting room  and our lunch awaited us upon the table      i am so delighted that you have come     she said earnestly     it is so very kind of you both  but indeed i do not know what i should do  your advice will be altogether invaluable to me         pray tell us what has happened to you         i will do so  and i must be quick  for i have promised mr  rucastle to be back before three  i got his leave to come into town this morning  though he little knew for what purpose         let us have everything in its due order     holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen      in the first place  i may say that i have met  on the whole  with no actual ill treatment from mr  and mrs  rucastle  it is only fair to them to say that  but i cannot understand them  and i am not easy in my mind about them         what can you not understand         their reasons for their conduct  but you shall have it all just as it occurred  when i came down  mr  rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog cart to the copper beeches  it is  as he said  beautifully situated  but it is not beautiful in itself  for it is a large square block of a house  whitewashed  but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather  there are grounds round it  woods on three sides  and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the southampton highroad  which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door  this ground in front belongs to the house  but the woods all round are part of lord southerton   s preserves  a clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place      i was driven over by my employer  who was as amiable as ever  and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child  there was no truth  mr  holmes  in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at baker street  mrs  rucastle is not mad  i found her to be a silent  pale faced woman  much younger than her husband  not more than thirty  i should think  while he can hardly be less than forty five  from their conversation i have gathered that they have been married about seven years  that he was a widower  and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to philadelphia  mr  rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother  as the daughter could not have been less than twenty  i can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father   s young wife      mrs  rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature  she impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse  she was a nonentity  it was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son  her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other  noting every little want and forestalling it if possible  he was kind to her also in his bluff  boisterous fashion  and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple  and yet she had some secret sorrow  this woman  she would often be lost in deep thought  with the saddest look upon her face  more than once i have surprised her in tears  i have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind  for i have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill natured a little creature  he is small for his age  with a head which is quite disproportionately large  his whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking  giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement  and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice  little birds  and insects  but i would rather not talk about the creature  mr  holmes  and  indeed  he has little to do with my story         i am glad of all details     remarked my friend     whether they seem to you to be relevant or not         i shall try not to miss anything of importance  the one unpleasant thing about the house  which struck me at once  was the appearance and conduct of the servants  there are only two  a man and his wife  toller  for that is his name  is a rough  uncouth man  with grizzled hair and whiskers  and a perpetual smell of drink  twice since i have been with them he has been quite drunk  and yet mr  rucastle seemed to take no notice of it  his wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face  as silent as mrs  rucastle and much less amiable  they are a most unpleasant couple  but fortunately i spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room  which are next to each other in one corner of the building      for two days after my arrival at the copper beeches my life was very quiet  on the third  mrs  rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband         oh  yes     said he  turning to me     we are very much obliged to you  miss hunter  for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair  i assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance  we shall now see how the electric blue dress will become you  you will find it laid out upon the bed in your room  and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged         the dress which i found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue  it was of excellent material  a sort of beige  but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before  it could not have been a better fit if i had been measured for it  both mr  and mrs  rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it  which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence  they were waiting for me in the drawing room  which is a very large room  stretching along the entire front of the house  with three long windows reaching down to the floor  a chair had been placed close to the central window  with its back turned towards it  in this i was asked to sit  and then mr  rucastle  walking up and down on the other side of the room  began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that i have ever listened to  you cannot imagine how comical he was  and i laughed until i was quite weary  mrs  rucastle  however  who has evidently no sense of humour  never so much as smiled  but sat with her hands in her lap  and a sad  anxious look upon her face  after an hour or so  mr  rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day  and that i might change my dress and go to little edward in the nursery      two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances  again i changed my dress  again i sat in the window  and again i laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense  r  pertoire   and which he told inimitably  then he handed me a yellow backed novel  and moving my chair a little sideways  that my own shadow might not fall upon the page  he begged me to read aloud to him  i read for about ten minutes  beginning in the heart of a chapter  and then suddenly  in the middle of a sentence  he ordered me to cease and to change my dress      you can easily imagine  mr  holmes  how curious i became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be  they were always very careful  i observed  to turn my face away from the window  so that i became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back  at first it seemed to be impossible  but i soon devised a means  my hand mirror had been broken  so a happy thought seized me  and i concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief  on the next occasion  in the midst of my laughter  i put my handkerchief up to my eyes  and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me  i confess that i was disappointed  there was nothing  at least that was my first impression  at the second glance  however  i perceived that there was a man standing in the southampton road  a small bearded man in a grey suit  who seemed to be looking in my direction  the road is an important highway  and there are usually people there  this man  however  was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up  i lowered my handkerchief and glanced at mrs  rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze  she said nothing  but i am convinced that she had divined that i had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me  she rose at once         jephro     said she     there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at miss hunter            no friend of yours  miss hunter     he asked         no  i know no one in these parts            dear me  how very impertinent  kindly turn round and motion to him to go away            surely it would be better to take no notice            no  no  we should have him loitering here always  kindly turn round and wave him away like that         i did as i was told  and at the same instant mrs  rucastle drew down the blind  that was a week ago  and from that time i have not sat again in the window  nor have i worn the blue dress  nor seen the man in the road         pray continue     said holmes     your narrative promises to be a most interesting one         you will find it rather disconnected  i fear  and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which i speak  on the very first day that i was at the copper beeches  mr  rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door  as we approached it i heard the sharp rattling of a chain  and the sound as of a large animal moving about         look in here     said mr  rucastle  showing me a slit between two planks     is he not a beauty         i looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes  and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness         don   t be frightened     said my employer  laughing at the start which i had given     it   s only carlo  my mastiff  i call him mine  but really old toller  my groom  is the only man who can do anything with him  we feed him once a day  and not too much then  so that he is always as keen as mustard  toller lets him loose every night  and god help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon  for goodness    sake don   t you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night  for it   s as much as your life is worth         the warning was no idle one  for two nights later i happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o   clock in the morning  it was a beautiful moonlight night  and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day  i was standing  rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene  when i was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches  as it emerged into the moonshine i saw what it was  it was a giant dog  as large as a calf  tawny tinted  with hanging jowl  black muzzle  and huge projecting bones  it walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side  that dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which i do not think that any burglar could have done      and now i have a very strange experience to tell you  i had  as you know  cut off my hair in london  and i had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk  one evening  after the child was in bed  i began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things  there was an old chest of drawers in the room  the two upper ones empty and open  the lower one locked  i had filled the first two with my linen  and as i had still much to pack away i was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer  it struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight  so i took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it  the very first key fitted to perfection  and i drew the drawer open  there was only one thing in it  but i am sure that you would never guess what it was  it was my coil of hair      i took it up and examined it  it was of the same peculiar tint  and the same thickness  but then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me  how could my hair have been locked in the drawer  with trembling hands i undid my trunk  turned out the contents  and drew from the bottom my own hair  i laid the two tresses together  and i assure you that they were identical  was it not extraordinary  puzzle as i would  i could make nothing at all of what it meant  i returned the strange hair to the drawer  and i said nothing of the matter to the rucastles as i felt that i had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked      i am naturally observant  as you may have remarked  mr  holmes  and i soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head  there was one wing  however  which appeared not to be inhabited at all  a door which faced that which led into the quarters of the tollers opened into this suite  but it was invariably locked  one day  however  as i ascended the stair  i met mr  rucastle coming out through this door  his keys in his hand  and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round  jovial man to whom i was accustomed  his cheeks were red  his brow was all crinkled with anger  and the veins stood out at his temples with passion  he locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look      this aroused my curiosity  so when i went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge  i strolled round to the side from which i could see the windows of this part of the house  there were four of them in a row  three of which were simply dirty  while the fourth was shuttered up  they were evidently all deserted  as i strolled up and down  glancing at them occasionally  mr  rucastle came out to me  looking as merry and jovial as ever         ah     said he     you must not think me rude if i passed you without a word  my dear young lady  i was preoccupied with business matters         i assured him that i was not offended     by the way     said i     you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there  and one of them has the shutters up         he looked surprised and  as it seemed to me  a little startled at my remark         photography is one of my hobbies     said he     i have made my dark room up there  but  dear me  what an observant young lady we have come upon  who would have believed it  who would have ever believed it     he spoke in a jesting tone  but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me  i read suspicion there and annoyance  but no jest      well  mr  holmes  from the moment that i understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which i was not to know  i was all on fire to go over them  it was not mere curiosity  though i have my share of that  it was more a feeling of duty   a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place  they talk of woman   s instinct  perhaps it was woman   s instinct which gave me that feeling  at any rate  it was there  and i was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door      it was only yesterday that the chance came  i may tell you that  besides mr  rucastle  both toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms  and i once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door  recently he has been drinking hard  and yesterday evening he was very drunk  and when i came upstairs there was the key in the door  i have no doubt at all that he had left it there  mr  and mrs  rucastle were both downstairs  and the child was with them  so that i had an admirable opportunity  i turned the key gently in the lock  opened the door  and slipped through      there was a little passage in front of me  unpapered and uncarpeted  which turned at a right angle at the farther end  round this corner were three doors in a line  the first and third of which were open  they each led into an empty room  dusty and cheerless  with two windows in the one and one in the other  so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them  the centre door was closed  and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed  padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall  and fastened at the other with stout cord  the door itself was locked as well  and the key was not there  this barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside  and yet i could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness  evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above  as i stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil  i suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door  a mad  unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight  mr  holmes  my overstrung nerves failed me suddenly  and i turned and ran   ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress  i rushed down the passage  through the door  and straight into the arms of mr  rucastle  who was waiting outside         so     said he  smiling     it was you  then  i thought that it must be when i saw the door open            oh  i am so frightened     i panted         my dear young lady  my dear young lady       you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was      and what has frightened you  my dear young lady         but his voice was just a little too coaxing  he overdid it  i was keenly on my guard against him         i was foolish enough to go into the empty wing     i answered     but it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that i was frightened and ran out again  oh  it is so dreadfully still in there            only that     said he  looking at me keenly         why  what did you think     i asked         why do you think that i lock this door            i am sure that i do not know            it is to keep people out who have no business there  do you see     he was still smiling in the most amiable manner         i am sure if i had known              well  then  you know now  and if you ever put your foot over that threshold again      here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage  and he glared down at me with the face of a demon      i   ll throw you to the mastiff         i was so terrified that i do not know what i did  i suppose that i must have rushed past him into my room  i remember nothing until i found myself lying on my bed trembling all over  then i thought of you  mr  holmes  i could not live there longer without some advice  i was frightened of the house  of the man  of the woman  of the servants  even of the child  they were all horrible to me  if i could only bring you down all would be well  of course i might have fled from the house  but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears  my mind was soon made up  i would send you a wire  i put on my hat and cloak  went down to the office  which is about half a mile from the house  and then returned  feeling very much easier  a horrible doubt came into my mind as i approached the door lest the dog might be loose  but i remembered that toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening  and i knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature  or who would venture to set him free  i slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you  i had no difficulty in getting leave to come into winchester this morning  but i must be back before three o   clock  for mr  and mrs  rucastle are going on a visit  and will be away all the evening  so that i must look after the child  now i have told you all my adventures  mr  holmes  and i should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means  and  above all  what i should do      holmes and i had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story  my friend rose now and paced up and down the room  his hands in his pockets  and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face      is toller still drunk     he asked      yes  i heard his wife tell mrs  rucastle that she could do nothing with him         that is well  and the rucastles go out to night         yes         is there a cellar with a good strong lock         yes  the wine cellar         you seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl  miss hunter  do you think that you could perform one more feat  i should not ask it of you if i did not think you a quite exceptional woman         i will try  what is it         we shall be at the copper beeches by seven o   clock  my friend and i  the rucastles will be gone by that time  and toller will  we hope  be incapable  there only remains mrs  toller  who might give the alarm  if you could send her into the cellar on some errand  and then turn the key upon her  you would facilitate matters immensely         i will do it         excellent  we shall then look thoroughly into the affair  of course there is only one feasible explanation  you have been brought there to personate someone  and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber  that is obvious  as to who this prisoner is  i have no doubt that it is the daughter  miss alice rucastle  if i remember right  who was said to have gone to america  you were chosen  doubtless  as resembling her in height  figure  and the colour of your hair  hers had been cut off  very possibly in some illness through which she has passed  and so  of course  yours had to be sacrificed also  by a curious chance you came upon her tresses  the man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers   possibly her  fianc      and no doubt  as you wore the girl   s dress and were so like her  he was convinced from your laughter  whenever he saw you  and afterwards from your gesture  that miss rucastle was perfectly happy  and that she no longer desired his attentions  the dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her  so much is fairly clear  the most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child         what on earth has that to do with it     i ejaculated      my dear watson  you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents  don   t you see that the converse is equally valid  i have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children  this child   s disposition is abnormally cruel  merely for cruelty   s sake  and whether he derives this from his smiling father  as i should suspect  or from his mother  it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power         i am sure that you are right  mr  holmes     cried our client     a thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it  oh  let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature         we must be circumspect  for we are dealing with a very cunning man  we can do nothing until seven o   clock  at that hour we shall be with you  and it will not be long before we solve the mystery      we were as good as our word  for it was just seven when we reached the copper beeches  having put up our trap at a wayside public house  the group of trees  with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun  were sufficient to mark the house even had miss hunter not been standing smiling on the door step      have you managed it     asked holmes   a loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs     that is mrs  toller in the cellar     said she     her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug  here are his keys  which are the duplicates of mr  rucastle   s         you have done well indeed     cried holmes with enthusiasm     now lead the way  and we shall soon see the end of this black business      we passed up the stair  unlocked the door  followed on down a passage  and found ourselves in front of the barricade which miss hunter had described  holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar  then he tried the various keys in the lock  but without success  no sound came from within  and at the silence holmes    face clouded over      i trust that we are not too late     said he     i think  miss hunter  that we had better go in without you  now  watson  put your shoulder to it  and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in      it was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength  together we rushed into the room  it was empty  there was no furniture save a little pallet bed  a small table  and a basketful of linen  the skylight above was open  and the prisoner gone      there has been some villainy here     said holmes     this beauty has guessed miss hunter   s intentions and has carried his victim off         but how         through the skylight  we shall soon see how he managed it     he swung himself up onto the roof     ah  yes     he cried     here   s the end of a long light ladder against the eaves  that is how he did it         but it is impossible     said miss hunter     the ladder was not there when the rucastles went away         he has come back and done it  i tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man  i should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step i hear now upon the stair  i think  watson  that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready      the words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room  a very fat and burly man  with a heavy stick in his hand  miss hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him  but sherlock holmes sprang forward and confronted him      you villain     said he     where   s your daughter      the fat man cast his eyes round  and then up at the open skylight      it is for me to ask you that     he shrieked     you thieves  spies and thieves  i have caught you  have i  you are in my power  i   ll serve you     he turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go      he   s gone for the dog     cried miss hunter      i have my revolver     said i      better close the front door     cried holmes  and we all rushed down the stairs together  we had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound  and then a scream of agony  with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to  an elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door      my god     he cried     someone has loosed the dog  it   s not been fed for two days  quick  quick  or it   ll be too late      holmes and i rushed out and round the angle of the house  with toller hurrying behind us  there was the huge famished brute  its black muzzle buried in rucastle   s throat  while he writhed and screamed upon the ground  running up  i blew its brains out  and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck  with much labour we separated them and carried him  living but horribly mangled  into the house  we laid him upon the drawing room sofa  and having dispatched the sobered toller to bear the news to his wife  i did what i could to relieve his pain  we were all assembled round him when the door opened  and a tall  gaunt woman entered the room      mrs  toller     cried miss hunter      yes  miss  mr  rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you  ah  miss  it is a pity you didn   t let me know what you were planning  for i would have told you that your pains were wasted         ha     said holmes  looking keenly at her     it is clear that mrs  toller knows more about this matter than anyone else         yes  sir  i do  and i am ready enough to tell what i know         then  pray  sit down  and let us hear it for there are several points on which i must confess that i am still in the dark         i will soon make it clear to you     said she     and i   d have done so before now if i could ha    got out from the cellar  if there   s police court business over this  you   ll remember that i was the one that stood your friend  and that i was miss alice   s friend too      she was never happy at home  miss alice wasn   t  from the time that her father married again  she was slighted like and had no say in anything  but it never really became bad for her until after she met mr  fowler at a friend   s house  as well as i could learn  miss alice had rights of her own by will  but she was so quiet and patient  she was  that she never said a word about them but just left everything in mr  rucastle   s hands  he knew he was safe with her  but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward  who would ask for all that the law would give him  then her father thought it time to put a stop on it  he wanted her to sign a paper  so that whether she married or not  he could use her money  when she wouldn   t do it  he kept on worrying her until she got brain fever  and for six weeks was at death   s door  then she got better at last  all worn to a shadow  and with her beautiful hair cut off  but that didn   t make no change in her young man  and he stuck to her as true as man could be         ah     said holmes     i think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear  and that i can deduce all that remains  mr  rucastle then  i presume  took to this system of imprisonment         yes  sir         and brought miss hunter down from london in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of mr  fowler         that was it  sir         but mr  fowler being a persevering man  as a good seaman should be  blockaded the house  and having met you succeeded by certain arguments  metallic or otherwise  in convincing you that your interests were the same as his         mr  fowler was a very kind spoken  free handed gentleman     said mrs  toller serenely      and in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink  and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out         you have it  sir  just as it happened         i am sure we owe you an apology  mrs  toller     said holmes     for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us  and here comes the country surgeon and mrs  rucastle  so i think  watson  that we had best escort miss hunter back to winchester  as it seems to me that our  locus standi  now is rather a questionable one      and thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door  mr  rucastle survived  but was always a broken man  kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife  they still live with their old servants  who probably know so much of rucastle   s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them  mr  fowler and miss rucastle were married  by special license  in southampton the day after their flight  and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of mauritius  as to miss violet hunter  my friend holmes  rather to my disappointment  manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems  and she is now the head of a private school at walsall  where i believe that she has met with considerable success        end of the project gutenberg ebook of
